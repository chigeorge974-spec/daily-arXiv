### [1] [GHOST: Unmasking Phantom States in Mamba2 via Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection & Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11408)
*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity increase, using forward-pass statistics to approximate control-theoretic balanced truncation without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but creates substantial inference overhead during autoregressive generation, saturating bandwidth. Standard pruning methods fail: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods are too costly.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) uses structured pruning that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. It jointly measures controllability and observability to rival gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation.

Result: On models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, GHOST achieves 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2, significantly reducing inference overhead while maintaining model fidelity.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an efficient structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that addresses inference bottlenecks by reducing state dimensions with minimal performance degradation, using forward-pass statistics to approximate theoretically optimal truncation without expensive gradient computations.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

### [2] [Explaining AI Without Code: A User Study on Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11159)
*Natalia Abarca,Andrés Carvallo,Claudia López Moncada,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-centered XAI module was integrated into DashAI, a no-code ML platform, combining PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. User study with 20 participants (novices and experts) showed high task success, positive novice feedback on explanation quality, and improved trust in automation, highlighting the challenge of making XAI accessible to novices while detailed enough for experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of ML in sensitive domains raises transparency concerns, while existing XAI methods require technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is critical in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI but rarely include explainability features.

Method: Developed a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform, integrating three complementary techniques: Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. Conducted a user study with 20 participants (ML novices and experts) to evaluate usability and impact of explanations using the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS) and Trust in Automation scale (TiA).

Result: Results showed: (i) high task success (≥80%) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on ESS (Cronbach's α = 0.74), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on TiA (α = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML: making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts. The integrated XAI module in DashAI demonstrates potential for bridging this gap while maintaining usability across different user expertise levels.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

### [3] [Latent Generative Solvers for Generalizable Long-Term Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11229)
*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Generative Solvers (LGS) is a two-stage framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that maps diverse PDE states to a shared latent space via VAE, learns probabilistic dynamics with Transformer via flow matching, and uses uncertainty perturbation and flow forcing for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems with reliable, uncertainty-aware neural solvers that reduce rollout drift and enable scalable pretraining for generalizable scientific workflows.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) pretrained VAE maps diverse PDE states to shared latent physics space, (2) Transformer learns probabilistic latent dynamics via flow matching. Key mechanisms: uncertainty knob perturbs latent inputs during training/inference to correct off-manifold drift; flow forcing updates system descriptor from generated trajectories to align train/test conditioning.

Result: Pretrained on ~2.5M trajectories at 128² resolution across 12 PDE families. Matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines. Shows efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow with limited finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows, enabling scalable pretraining and efficient adaptation.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

### [4] [On Decision-Valued Maps and Representational Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11295)
*Gil Raitses*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecisionDB: Infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing decision-valued maps that track how different data representations affect computational outcomes, enabling deterministic replay and persistence region analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can produce different computational outcomes, creating a need to systematically track which representations preserve results versus change them, and to enable reliable decision reuse.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate representations with discrete outcomes, implements DecisionDB infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing these relationships using content-based identifiers and write-once artifact storage with deterministic replay.

Result: Creates a framework that partitions representation space into persistence regions (where outcomes are preserved) and boundaries (where outcomes change), and establishes decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition through exact identifier matching.

Conclusion: The approach provides systematic infrastructure for managing representation-dependent computational decisions, enabling reliable auditing, deterministic replay, and formal treatment of decision persistence across different data representations.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

TL;DR: Voxtral Realtime is a streaming ASR model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency through end-to-end streaming training and novel architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current streaming ASR approaches often adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, which can compromise quality and latency. There's a need for natively streaming models that can match offline transcription quality while maintaining low latency for real-time applications.

Method: End-to-end streaming training with explicit audio-text alignment; Delayed Streams Modeling framework with new causal audio encoder; Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning; large-scale pretraining on 13 languages.

Result: At 480ms delay, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper (widely deployed offline system); model weights released under Apache 2.0 license.

Conclusion: Voxtral Realtime demonstrates that natively streaming ASR models can match offline transcription quality at sub-second latency through proper architectural design and training methodology, enabling high-quality real-time speech recognition.

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

### [6] [The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: A Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture for Securing Enterprise AI Estates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
*John M. Willis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PBSAI introduces a multi-agent reference architecture for securing enterprise AI estates, organizing security into 12 domains with bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises are rapidly deploying LLMs, RAG pipelines, and tool-using agents on shared infrastructure, creating complex AI estates that existing governance frameworks (like NIST AI RMF) don't adequately address with implementable architectures for multi-agent, AI-enabled cyber defense.

Method: Develops PBSAI Governance Ecosystem with 12-domain taxonomy, bounded agent families, shared context envelopes, and structured output contracts. Includes lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem-level invariants for traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrates application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. Provides structured, evidence-centric foundation for open ecosystem development.

Conclusion: PBSAI offers a practical, implementable architecture for securing complex AI estates that bridges the gap between high-level governance principles and real-world deployment needs in enterprise and hyperscale environments.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

### [7] [Dissecting Subjectivity and the "Ground Truth" Illusion in Data Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11318)
*Sheza Munir,Benjamin Mah,Krisha Kalsi,Shivani Kapania,Julian Posada,Edith Law,Ding Wang,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review reveals how data annotation practices create a "consensus trap" by treating human disagreement as noise, masking cultural pluralism, and imposing Western norms as universal benchmarks through model-mediated annotations and precarious labor conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper critiques the foundational "ground truth" paradigm in machine learning as a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than sociotechnical signal, investigating how annotation practices facilitate a "consensus trap" that erases cultural diversity.

Method: Systematic literature review of 30,897 records from 2010-2025 across seven premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS), refined via tiered keyword filtration to 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in 346 papers for qualitative synthesis using reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Reveals systemic failures in positional legibility combined with human-as-verifier models introduce anchoring bias and remove human voices; geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks; precarious data workers prioritize compliance over honest subjectivity; statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error.

Conclusion: Argues for reclaiming disagreement as high-fidelity signal essential for culturally competent models and proposes a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift from discovering singular "right" answers to mapping diversity of human experience.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

### [8] [Bi-Level Prompt Optimization for Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11340)
*Bo Pan,Xuan Kan,Kaitai Zhang,Yan Yan,Shunwen Tan,Zihao He,Zixin Ding,Junjie Wu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLPO: Bi-level prompt optimization framework for multimodal LLM judges that converts images to textual representations to overcome context window limitations in evaluating AI-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI-generated content, but aligning them with human judgments is challenging. Supervised fine-tuning is costly and inflexible, while existing auto prompt optimization methods focus on text-only evaluations and don't address multimodal limitations where visual examples consume too much context window space.

Method: Proposes BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Uses bi-level optimization to jointly refine the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt, enabling effective trial-and-error prompt refinement within limited context budgets.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving multimodal LLM-based evaluation of AI-generated images.

Conclusion: BLPO successfully addresses the context window bottleneck in multimodal prompt optimization by converting images to textual representations, enabling more efficient and effective alignment of LLM judges with human judgments for evaluating AI-generated images.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### [9] [AgentNoiseBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Tool-Using LLM Agents Under Noisy Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11348)
*Ruipeng Wang,Yuxin Chen,Yukai Wang,Chang Wu,Junfeng Fang,Xiaodong Cai,Qi Gu,Hui Su,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench is a framework for systematically evaluating LLM-based agent robustness under noisy real-world conditions by injecting controllable noise into existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant performance gap between LLM-based agents on benchmarks versus real-world deployments due to idealized assumptions in training/evaluation that overlook inherent stochasticity and noise in real-world interactions.

Method: 1) Analyze real-world biases/uncertainties and categorize environmental noise into user-noise and tool-noise; 2) Develop automated pipeline to inject controllable noise into existing agent benchmarks while preserving task solvability; 3) Conduct extensive evaluations across diverse models with various architectures and parameter scales.

Result: Results show consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, revealing the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench provides a systematic framework for evaluating agent robustness under noisy conditions, highlighting the need to address environmental noise in agent development and evaluation to bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that balances task performance and user engagement in proactive LLM agents through behavior enhancement for better reasoning and information gathering, combined with behavior regularization to reduce inefficient interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt to user intentions, while excessive human feedback reduces user satisfaction.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (enriching proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (suppressing inefficient/redundant interactions and aligning agent behavior with user expectations).

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines and achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios by balancing task completion efficiency with user engagement through its dual enhancement-regularization approach.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench is a new benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to replicate scientific research claims, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by including both replicable and non-replicable papers and testing the full replication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agents in scientific paper assessment focus primarily on computational reproduction with code/data access, but fail to capture real-world replication challenges like inconsistent data availability, lack ground-truth diversity by only including reproducible papers, and evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark with human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims from social/behavioral sciences, evaluating AI agents across three stages: (1) extraction/retrieval of replication data, (2) design/execution of computational experiments, and (3) interpretation of results. Also develops ReplicatorAgent framework with tools like web search and sandboxed environments.

Result: Evaluation of ReplicatorAgent across four LLMs shows current LLM agents can effectively design and execute computational experiments but struggle with retrieving necessary resources like new data for replication. Different programming languages and code access levels were also tested.

Conclusion: The benchmark addresses critical gaps in evaluating AI agents for scientific replication, revealing current limitations in resource retrieval while demonstrating capabilities in experimental design. The framework provides a foundation for developing more capable research replication agents.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/llm-benchmarking.

### [12] [TRACER: Trajectory Risk Aggregation for Critical Episodes in Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11409)
*Sina Tayebati,Divake Kumar,Nastaran Darabi,Davide Ettori,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-using interactions that detects critical failure episodes by combining content-aware surprisal, situational-awareness signals, semantic/lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals in multi-turn tool-using interactions, where failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on the τ²-bench for predicting task failure and selective task execution, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: TRACER provides an effective trajectory-level uncertainty metric that captures critical failure episodes in multi-turn tool-using interactions, outperforming existing single-shot uncertainty proxies and enabling better failure prediction and selective execution.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

TL;DR: AT-RL selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual tokens via graph clustering, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead by focusing credit assignment on visual anchors rather than all tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RLVR for MLLMs, understanding how visual evidence integrates during reasoning remains unclear. The authors investigate multimodal RLVR through cross-modal attention connectivity to identify key visual-textual coupling patterns.

Method: Analyze cross-modal attention connectivity in RLVR, discover only ~15% of tokens show strong visual-textual coupling (anchor tokens). Propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens using graph-based clustering of attention topology.

Result: AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead but enables 32B model to surpass 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2). Consistent gains across STEM, video, and general tasks. Training only on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming importance of visual anchors.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality in multimodal RLVR is governed by fidelity of cross-modal anchoring rather than token quantity. AT-RL's selective reinforcement of high-connectivity visual anchors enables efficient and effective multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A continuous learning framework that treats internal reasoning processes as primary learning objects, enabling systems to optimize reasoning structures and learning mechanisms alongside task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches focus on task outputs and static knowledge but neglect continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling, and learning mechanisms, limiting sustained adaptation in dynamic environments.

Method: Human-inspired framework unifying reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within sequential reasoning enhanced by parallel learning; treats internal thinking processes as learning objects; records reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material; supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures; includes hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism.

Result: Experimental results on temperature sensor abnormality detection show 23.9% reduction in average runtime when incorporating internal-process learning.

Conclusion: The framework enables systems to progressively evolve internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability, achieving learning alongside processing and continuous improvement of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: INTENT is an inference-time planning framework for budget-constrained tool-augmented LLM agents that uses intention-aware hierarchical world modeling to anticipate future tool usage and costs, enabling strict budget adherence while improving task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need to solve multi-step tasks using external tools under strict monetary budgets, but direct planning is intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high outcome variance, and prohibitive exploration costs in priced, stochastic tool execution environments.

Method: INTENT uses an inference-time planning framework with intention-aware hierarchical world models to anticipate future tool usage and risk-calibrated costs. It guides decisions online through sequential decision making in context space with priced, stochastic tool executions.

Result: On cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines. It remains robust under dynamic market shifts including tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT effectively addresses the challenges of budget-constrained tool-augmented agents by combining intention-aware hierarchical modeling with inference-time planning, enabling practical deployment of LLM agents in real-world scenarios with monetary constraints.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative modeling for semantic-statistical population synthesis, using persona representations as semantic conditioning while enforcing marginal alignment, achieving improved distribution matching and sample feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints but lack semantic-conditioned generation that captures abstract behavioral patterns implicit in survey data, creating a gap in joint representation of statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics.

Method: SemaPop framework derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records using LLMs, incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, and introduces marginal regularization to enforce alignment with target population marginals, instantiated with WGAN-GP backbone (SemaPop-GAN).

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning; ablation studies confirm contributions of semantic persona conditioning and architectural choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion and provides a modular foundation for generative population projection systems integrating individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

TL;DR: ARC learns query-specific agent configurations via RL, outperforming fixed templates by 25% accuracy while reducing compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed configurations or hand-tuned heuristics, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute costs applied uniformly to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as query-wise decision problem; introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner) that learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations per query.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented QA, learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating the value of adaptive, query-specific configuration strategies.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

*Jingdi Chen,Hanqing Yang,Zongjun Liu,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of multi-agent communication evolution through MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM-based approaches, analyzed via the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, where, why) with design patterns and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive framework for understanding multi-agent communication evolution across different research paradigms, connecting disparate research threads through a unified analytical lens (Five Ws), and identifying practical design patterns and open challenges for future hybrid systems.

Method: Survey methodology using the Five Ws framework (who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial) to analyze three major paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Emergent Language (EL), and Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems.

Result: Traces evolution from early MARL with hand-designed/implicit protocols to end-to-end learned communication, then to EL approaches for structured/symbolic communication, and finally to LLM-based systems with natural language priors. Identifies key trade-offs: task-specificity vs. generalization, interpretability vs. performance, and scalability limitations across paradigms.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration, addressing current limitations in grounding, generalization, and scalability while leveraging the strengths of each paradigm.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces a modality-aware RL post-training ecosystem with benchmark annotation, policy optimization, and adaptive scheduling to address modality-blind training issues in multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE comprises three components: (1) MAPLE-bench - first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO - modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. Systematic analysis establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design.

Conclusion: MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training, addressing the limitations of modality-blind approaches through explicit modality awareness in training, optimization, and scheduling.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

*Yiming Gao,Zhen Wang,Jefferson Chen,Mark Antkowiak,Mengzhou Hu,JungHo Kong,Dexter Pratt,Jieyuan Liu,Enze Ma,Zhiting Hu,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework enabling LLMs to perform omics-native reasoning by directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and using bioinformatics tools for tasks like cell-type annotation, trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM applications in biology often lack direct grounding in raw omics data, limiting their ability to perform transparent, auditable analyses. There's a need for systems that allow LLMs to reason directly with biological data while maintaining interpretability.

Method: scPilot converts core single-cell analyses into step-by-step reasoning problems where LLMs inspect single-cell RNA-seq data directly, use on-demand bioinformatics tools, and engage in iterative reasoning with justification and revision capabilities.

Result: Iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (using o1 model) and reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% (using Gemini-2.5-Pro) compared to one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses, advancing the field of AI-assisted biological discovery through transparent reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents exhibit significant behavioral inconsistency across identical task runs, with variance predicting failure rates - consistent agents achieve 80-92% accuracy while inconsistent ones only 25-60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when executing the same task multiple times, and to understand the relationship between behavioral variance and task success rates.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, analyzing action sequence variance and its correlation with accuracy.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average; tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks (≥6 unique paths) achieve only 25-60%, a 32-55 percentage point gap. 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: LLM agent behavior is often inconsistent across identical runs, and this variance strongly predicts failure. Monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

TL;DR: NMIPS is a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework that uses multifactorial optimization to discover analytical solutions for PDE families while transferring learned mathematical structures between related PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods require solving each PDE instance independently, incurring massive computational costs. Machine learning PDE solvers offer speed but lack interpretability as they provide numerical approximations rather than analytical expressions needed for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Employs an affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among related PDEs, avoiding solving each from scratch.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases show promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by providing efficient, interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through structure transfer and multifactorial optimization.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show strong performance on perception tasks but have a significant gap in mathematical spatial reasoning (parsing and manipulating 2D/3D relations), with most models failing to reach 60% accuracy on tasks where humans achieve over 95%.

Method: MathSpatial framework includes three components: (1) MathSpatial-Bench - a 2K problem benchmark across 3 categories and 11 subtypes designed to isolate reasoning from perceptual noise; (2) MathSpatial-Corpus - 8K training problems with verified solutions; (3) MathSpatial-SRT - structured reasoning traces using three atomic operations: Correlate, Constrain, and Infer.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25%, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing a fundamental weakness in current models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm with multi-dimensional matrix decomposition and unified optimization to address RLHF limitations in medical QA, achieving effective alignment across correctness, safety, and compliance objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL paradigms (RLHF and RL from verifiable rewards) are mismatched for medical QA due to expensive preference annotations, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and inability to handle complex clinical contexts. Medical alignment requires simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, but multi-objective heterogeneous rewards suffer from scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.

Method: Constructs a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix decomposing objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Establishes closed loops where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis driving optimizable rewards. Proposes unified optimization with Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm that addresses fundamental limitations of current RL approaches for medical QA, providing fine-grained supervision signals and unified optimization to achieve comprehensive alignment across multiple critical dimensions.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic agentic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to address the semantic-physical disconnect in LLM-based CFD agents, achieving 96% relative improvement over baselines while reducing self-correction loops by 59% and token consumption by 17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD suffer from probabilistic nature that cannot enforce strict conservation laws and numerical stability, leading to physically invalid configurations due to "context poisoning" in semantic RAG approaches.

Method: PhyNiKCE employs a neurosymbolic architecture with a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, using a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions to rigidly enforce physical constraints.

Result: Validated through OpenFOAM experiments on practical CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrated 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59%, and lowered LLM token consumption by 17%.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in CFD automation, offering a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy AI in broader industrial automation beyond just CFD applications.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

### [27] [Benchmark Health Index: A Systematic Framework for Benchmarking the Benchmarks of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11674)
*Longyuan Zhu,Hairan Hua,Linlin Miao,Bing Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Benchmark Health Index (BHI) is a data-driven framework for auditing evaluation benchmarks along three axes: capability discrimination, anti-saturation, and impact, addressing the unreliability of current LLM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for Large Language Models are becoming unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, creating uncertainty about which evaluation results remain trustworthy in the rapidly advancing LLM field.

Method: BHI framework audits evaluation sets along three orthogonal axes: (1) Capability Discrimination - measures benchmark's ability to separate model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation - estimates remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution; (3) Impact - quantifies influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. The framework analyzes 106 validated benchmarks from technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025.

Result: BHI provides the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, systematically characterizing the evaluation landscape and enabling principled benchmark selection.

Conclusion: BHI offers a principled basis for benchmark selection and enables dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols, addressing the reliability crisis in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [28] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Rung Collapse as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models fail to distinguish association from intervention, leading to Aleatoric Entrenchment where correct outcomes reinforce flawed causal reasoning. It proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) as a belief revision objective with theoretical guarantees and practical architecture for recovering true interventional distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift. This pathology stems from autoregressive training's inability to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), leading to models that are "right for the wrong reasons" and become entrenched in flawed causal reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. It embeds this within a three-layer architecture with: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem linking actions to do-operations, (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, and (3) a failure mode taxonomy with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs show Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), with steerability exhibiting inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction. Targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails, with proven asymptotic recovery of true interventional distribution and finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: The paper formalizes Rung Collapse as a fundamental limitation of autoregressive training and proposes ERM as a principled solution that separates causal reasoning evaluation from task performance, enabling models to overcome Aleatoric Entrenchment and recover true interventional distributions through targeted belief revision.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

TL;DR: V2G pipeline converts CAD diagrams to property graphs to overcome structural blindness in MLLMs, achieving large accuracy gains on electrical compliance checks while MLLMs remain near chance level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Conclusion: Structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains, highlighting the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods for structural reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit token-based reasoning and latent reasoning based on model confidence, improving accuracy while reducing generation length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning efficiency varies across settings, and analysis shows that incorrect reasoning trajectories contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones. Soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter uses inference-time confidence-aware routing that routes thinking to discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to latent space otherwise, avoiding high confidence and noise propagation.

Result: Outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines with average 19.70 point improvement in Pass@1, reduces generation length by up to 15.55% across STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks with diverse large reasoning models.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter effectively calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning, accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence, and provides an efficient confidence-aware routing mechanism for improved reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses reverse KL divergence to measure functional divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates, outperforming existing methods while maintaining generalization and generation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs. There's a need for merging methods that explicitly control functional interference.

Method: SCF-RKL measures functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates. It uses a mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design that preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities, moving beyond the assumption of linear additivity in parameter space.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods across 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety. It demonstrates strong generalization and generation stability across various model scales and architectures, including both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL provides an effective model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates, offering superior performance and stability compared to existing parameter-space heuristic methods.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable preflight planning method for large UAV fleets that combines prioritized planning with iterative conflict resolution, handling temporal NFZs and heterogeneous vehicles while achieving near-100% success rates for up to 1,000 UAVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF methods lack the scalability and flexibility needed for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) with large UAV fleets in dynamic, shared airspace containing temporal No-Fly Zones, heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines.

Method: DTAPP-IICR uses: 1) Initial solution generation by prioritizing missions based on urgency; 2) SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner for roundtrip trajectories that handles heterogeneous UAVs, enforces temporal NFZs, and models conflicts as soft constraints; 3) Iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by a geometric conflict graph for residual conflict resolution; 4) Completeness-preserving directional pruning to accelerate 3D search.

Result: Achieves near-100% success rates with fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in UTM context, and scales successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace, addressing the limitations of existing MAPF methods for large-scale UAV fleet operations with temporal constraints.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

*Thomas Jiralerspong,Trenton Bricken*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First application of crosscoders for cross-architecture model diffing with new DFC modification to identify safety-critical features like political alignment, exceptionalism, and copyright refusal mechanisms in various LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model diffing methods are limited to comparing base models with their finetunes, but new LLM releases often involve novel architectures, requiring cross-architecture methods for broader applicability in identifying safety-critical behaviors.

Method: Introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification to better isolate features unique to one model, and applies crosscoders for the first time to cross-architecture model diffing in an unsupervised fashion.

Result: Successfully identified specific safety-critical features: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing with DFC modification is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, establishing it as a valuable technique for safety analysis.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems, featuring 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains with multi-GQL support and a novel evaluation framework that reveals significant dialect gaps in ISO-GQL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-GQL datasets are limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, and evaluation scope, hindering systematic comparison of model capabilities across different GQLs and domains.

Method: Developed Text2GQL-Bench with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets across different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs using heterogeneous resources, coupled with a multi-GQL dataset of 178,184 question-query pairs spanning 13 domains.

Result: Evaluation reveals a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: strong LLMs achieve only ≤4% execution accuracy in zero-shot settings, though 3-shot prompting raises accuracy to ~50% (grammatical validity <70%). A fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity.

Conclusion: Most performance improvement in ISO-GQL generation is unlocked by exposure to sufficient examples, highlighting the need for comprehensive benchmarks like Text2GQL-Bench to advance Text-to-GQL systems and address dialect-specific challenges.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

### [35] [AIR: Improving Agent Safety through Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11749)
*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is the first incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously manages detection, containment, recovery, and eradication of safety incidents during agent execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus on prevention but lack capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably occur, creating a critical gap in agent safety.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for incident response lifecycle management integrated into the agent's execution loop, enabling: (1) semantic incident detection grounded in environment state and context, (2) guided containment and recovery actions via agent tools, and (3) synthesis of guardrail rules during eradication to prevent future similar incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules, with experiments confirming the necessity of AIR's design components and showing its timeliness with moderate overhead.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, providing comprehensive post-incident management capabilities that complement existing preventive approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) improves multi-turn RL training by incorporating lightweight tree-style search during rollout generation to select high-scoring actions, enhancing trajectory quality and stabilizing learning without changing optimization objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL faces challenges with sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments, where naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and cause mode collapse. Current approaches struggle with generating high-quality training trajectories in these settings.

Method: TSR performs lightweight tree-style search during training-time rollout generation to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. It's implemented with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search methods, and can be paired with various optimizers like PPO and GRPO.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks with a one-time increase in training compute. The approach improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while remaining optimizer-agnostic.

Conclusion: TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning by moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, complementing existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods without changing underlying optimization objectives.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven binarization framework for species distribution models that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics, outperforming traditional thresholding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional binarization of probabilistic SDM predictions is heuristic and distorts species prevalence estimates and community composition, creating a need for more robust methods.

Method: MaxExp framework selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing evaluation metrics; SSE method predicts assemblages based on expected species richness; both require no calibration data and are computationally efficient.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization, offering superior performance over traditional methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment in a single end-to-end model, improving conversion metrics while maintaining policy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial ad systems use a two-stage approach (generation then alignment) that creates misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.

Method: RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into generation via policy learning, using multi-dimensional rewards that combine conversion-oriented metrics with compliance constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets show RELATE consistently outperforms baselines, and online deployment yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate under strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end reinforcement learning framework effectively unifies generation and alignment, producing higher-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance while maintaining compliance.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Yihao Liu,Ziyun Zhang,Zile He,Huaqian Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ES framework decouples task execution from workflow construction: LLM first solves task using tools, then reconstructs structured workflow from execution traces, improving accuracy over integrated approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately translating LLM reasoning and tool use into structured workflows is challenging. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between solving tasks and constructing workflows.

Method: Execute-Summarize (ES) framework: 1) Model first completes task using available tools (execution phase), 2) Independently reconstructs structured workflow from execution traces (summarization phase). This decoupling separates task execution from workflow construction.

Result: ES framework outperforms existing methods on FlowBench. The approach improves workflow accuracy and robustness by eliminating interference between task solving and workflow construction processes.

Conclusion: The ES framework provides a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows through decoupled execution and summarization phases, offering improved accuracy over integrated approaches.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems through specialized agents coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, achieving massive scalability and cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, with limitations in procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized agents (Solution Agent for problem solving, Illustration Agent for visualization codes, Narration Agent for instructional scripts) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent with quality gates, iterative critique mechanisms, semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding one million videos per day with over 95% cost reduction compared to industry-standard approaches while maintaining high acceptance rate; generates structured executable video scripts deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration.

Conclusion: LAVES successfully addresses limitations of prior approaches by decomposing educational video generation into specialized tasks with quality controls, enabling automated, scalable, cost-effective production of logically rigorous instructional content.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-kNN Distance is a black-box detection method that identifies RLVR-trained examples by measuring reduced diversity in model generations, outperforming existing contamination detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training creates benchmark contamination concerns because it fine-tunes models using reward feedback rather than token-level probabilities, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods ineffective. There's a need for reliable detection methods that don't require access to reference models or token probabilities.

Method: The paper introduces Min-kNN Distance, a black-box detector that quantifies behavioral signatures of RLVR training. It works by: 1) Sampling multiple completions for a given prompt, 2) Computing edit distances between all pairs of completions, 3) Taking the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor distances. This measures the collapse in generation diversity that occurs when prompts have been seen during RLVR training.

Result: Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones. The method outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines, demonstrating effectiveness without requiring access to reference models or token probabilities.

Conclusion: RLVR training induces distinctive behavioral signatures characterized by reduced generation diversity for seen prompts. The proposed Min-kNN Distance provides an effective, practical detection method for RLVR contamination that works in black-box settings and outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

### [42] [Hi-SAM: A Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal Framework for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11799)
*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM is a hierarchical structure-aware multi-modal recommendation framework that addresses tokenization and architecture limitations in semantic ID-based approaches through disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical memory-anchor transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal recommendation systems using semantic IDs face two key challenges: (1) suboptimal tokenization where existing methods lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse, and (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens.

Method: Hi-SAM introduces two key designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via coarse-to-fine strategy with shared codebooks for consensus and modality-specific codebooks for nuances, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory while retaining details for current items.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing semantic ID-based multi-modal recommendation systems by introducing hierarchical structure awareness and disentangled tokenization, leading to significant performance improvements in both offline evaluations and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

*Lianjun Wu,Shengchen Zhu,Yuxuan Liu,Liuyu Kai,Xiaoduan Feng,Duomin Wang,Wenshuo Liu,Jingxuan Zhang,Kelvin Li,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM enhances latent diffusion models for high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting by addressing limited diffusability through 3D-MAE encoding and variable-aware spectral regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models struggle with limited diffusability in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to: 1) lack of task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures in meteorological fields (unlike natural images), making VFM-based regularization inapplicable; 2) existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under homogeneity assumptions, which fails to account for inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning for the diffusion model; 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable, addressing inter-variable spectral heterogeneity.

Result: PuYun-LDM enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble) at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. The system generates a 15-day global forecast with 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, with ensemble forecasts efficiently produced in parallel.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-MAE encoding and VA-MFM strategy effectively address the limited diffusability of LDMs in high-resolution weather forecasting by providing better conditioning and adaptive spectral regularization that accounts for inter-variable heterogeneity, enabling efficient and accurate ensemble weather predictions.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight framework using the main model's hidden states for efficient sequence length prediction to reduce padding waste in LLM serving and RL sampling, featuring entropy-guided token pooling for static prediction and progressive length prediction for stochastic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and RL sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods using auxiliary models incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: A lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) - uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) - dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation.

Result: Built and released ForeLen benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16% over best baseline. Integration with length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: The work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by addressing padding waste through lightweight length prediction using the main model's internal states, with applications in both static and stochastic generation scenarios.

*Jialin Wu,Wei Shi,Han Shen,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Zhicong Huang,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS is a training-free framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention at specific network depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination due to visual features and pretrained textual representations becoming intertwined in deeper network layers, suppressing visual information.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information vectors and employs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where visual suppression occurs, without requiring training.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving general reasoning capabilities, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through precise geometric interventions in latent space.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a prototype-based autoregressive LM architecture that offers interpretability through nameable concept prototypes while maintaining competitive performance and linear sequence length scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art language models have opaque reasoning processes that undermine trust and introduce risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for interpretable-by-design architectures that maintain performance while providing transparency.

Method: Introduces Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) - an autoregressive LM architecture based on parameter vectors (prototypes) instead of standard self-attention. Features two-way communication between input sequence and prototypes, where prototypes automatically capture nameable concepts during training and create communication channels aggregating contextual information at different time scales.

Result: ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs well on text generation and GLUE tasks, scales well with model/data size, shows robustness to input perturbations comparable to baselines, and provides interpretable pathways showing how robustness/sensitivity arises. Prototypes capture concepts like "woman" and enable targeted behavior edits.

Conclusion: ProtoT achieves close to state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretability by design, paving the way for well-performing autoregressive LMs with transparent reasoning processes that can be understood and edited.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

TL;DR: VRCsim simulation framework generates VRC cooperative perception data, enabling creation of VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying. Talk2DM module adds natural language querying to VRC dynamic maps using chain-of-prompt mechanism combining human rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic map systems for vehicle-road-cloud cooperative autonomous driving lack natural-language-supported human interfaces, limiting human-DM interaction despite successful deployments in Japan.

Method: Develop VRCsim simulation framework to generate streaming VRC cooperative perception data, create VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying, and propose Talk2DM module using chain-of-prompt mechanism that integrates human-defined rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy with Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, with average response time of 2-5 seconds. Larger models show higher accuracy but significant efficiency degradation.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully extends VRC dynamic map systems with natural language querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities, demonstrating strong generalization across different LLMs and practical potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

Motivation: Current AI task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, lack adaptability to environmental changes, and cannot robustly handle unexpected failures, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through meaningful collaboration.

Method: An adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation that involves a sequence of decisions including task allocation, transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications and boundaries, clarity of intent, and trust establishment mechanisms between parties.

Result: The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex delegation networks and aims to inform development of protocols for the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: The framework addresses limitations of current delegation methods by providing a comprehensive, adaptive approach that incorporates essential delegation components beyond simple task allocation, enabling more robust and effective collaboration in complex AI systems.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSAE is a hierarchical sparse autoencoder that jointly learns multiple SAEs with parent-child relationships to capture multi-scale conceptual structures in LLMs, outperforming standard SAEs in recovering semantically meaningful hierarchies while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders extract monosemantic features from LLMs in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical natural language structure. Feature splitting phenomena indicate this hierarchical organization, necessitating methods to discover multi-scale conceptual structures.

Method: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) jointly learns a series of SAEs and parent-child relationships between their features. It uses two novel mechanisms: structural constraint loss to strengthen parent-child alignment, and random feature perturbation mechanism to enhance hierarchical structure learning.

Result: Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers show HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, validated by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. HSAE maintains reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations, addressing the limitation of standard SAEs that extract features in isolation without capturing hierarchical relationships.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) framework enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing detail of uncertain content rather than binary abstention, improving factual accuracy while preserving information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to factual errors that limit adoption in high-risk settings. Binary uncertainty estimation (abstention when confidence is low) is too restrictive in long-form generation, often discarding valuable information.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Proposes Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms baselines, improving area under risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating improved accuracy and reliability while preserving original meaning.

Conclusion: Selective Abstraction provides a more nuanced alternative to binary abstention, allowing LLMs to trade specificity for reliability, improving factual correctness while retaining valuable information in long-form generation tasks.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE is a novel alpha mining framework that models factor evolution as a DAG, using Bayesian retrieval and DAG-aware generation to achieve superior performance in automated factor discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha mining methods (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) lack global structural perspective, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity.

Method: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where factors are nodes and evolutionary links are edges. It consists of: 1) Bayesian Factor Retriever that balances exploitation-exploration via posterior probability model, and 2) DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages full ancestral traces for context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate AlphaPROBE achieves significantly enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery, and AlphaPROBE's DAG-based approach provides a principled framework for strategic factor mining.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

TL;DR: MEME proposes a logic-oriented framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of competing investment narratives, outperforming traditional asset-centric and market-centric approaches through semantic analysis of investment arguments and temporal alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantitative finance methods are limited to either asset-centric stock prediction or market-centric portfolio allocation, lacking understanding of the underlying reasoning and narratives that drive market movements. The authors aim to move beyond these paradigms by modeling markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment logics.

Method: MEME employs: 1) multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments; 2) Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within semantic space; 3) temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track lifecycle and historical profitability of investment modes; 4) prioritization of enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies for portfolio construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023-2025 show MEME consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case studies, and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to evolving market consensus.

Conclusion: The logic-oriented perspective successfully models financial markets as evolutionary ecosystems of competing investment narratives. MEME demonstrates superior performance by reconstructing market dynamics through evolving logics, prioritizing robust reasoning over transient anomalies, and adapting to changing market consensus.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic asynchronous environments with temporal constraints, dynamic events, ambiguity, and collaboration, featuring action-level evaluation and reinforcement learning compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior evaluations are static or synchronous, lacking realistic asynchronous environments where environments evolve independently of agent actions. There's a need for benchmarks that test agents under temporal constraints, dynamic events, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration in practical scenarios.

Method: Gaia2 introduces scenarios with independently evolving environments, paired with write-action verifiers for fine-grained action-level evaluation. Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments (ARE) platform, it enables reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards and is designed for extensibility.

Result: Evaluation shows no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 achieves 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks; Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy/speed for cost; Kimi-K2 leads open-source models with 21% pass@1. Results reveal trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap.

Conclusion: Gaia2 provides a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems. By releasing Gaia2 with the ARE framework, the authors aim to advance the next generation of LLM agents capable of operating in realistic asynchronous environments.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

TL;DR: CSEval is a framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their conditioning prompts, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation focus on realism and diversity but fail to assess whether generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology, which is critical for safe healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval) framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their conditioning prompts.

Result: CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and demonstrates correlation with expert judgment, providing clinically meaningful evaluation.

Conclusion: CSEval offers a scalable, clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring generated images reflect intended clinical semantics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from LLM reasoning to enhance performance without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhance LLM reasoning through behavior-related prompt adjustments are largely intuitive and lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to systematically investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral pattern perspective.

Method: The authors first observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types. They propose two optimization methods: 1) InjectCorrect - guides models by imitating behavioral patterns from their own past correct answers; 2) InjectRLOpt - learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses a Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference.

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter updates, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Systematically leveraging behavioral patterns from LLM reasoning can significantly enhance reasoning performance without requiring model parameter updates, demonstrating the importance of understanding and utilizing intrinsic behavioral patterns in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain, compromising procedural compliance in legal decision-making.

Method: LawThinker adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance. It includes a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks, enforcing verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the verification gap in legal reasoning by enforcing stepwise validation, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic judicial environments while maintaining generalization across static benchmarks, representing a significant advancement in procedural compliance for legal AI systems.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes.

### [57] [Differentiable Modal Logic for Multi-Agent Diagnosis, Orchestration and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12083)
*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data in multi-agent systems, providing a neurosymbolic debugging framework for semantic failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent AI systems evolving from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms require debugging semantic failures involving knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation. Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) enables systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone. The framework uses four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (causality), deontic (permissions), and doxastic (confidence interpretation).

Result: Demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios including discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games and detecting LLM hallucinations. Provides interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, knowledge injection via differentiable axioms, compositional multi-modal reasoning, and practical deployment patterns.

Conclusion: DML provides a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework that enables learning modal logic structures from data, making logical contradictions learnable optimization objectives, with practical applications for monitoring, active control, and communication in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StateLM introduces foundation models with internal reasoning loops to actively manage their own state through memory tools, enabling dynamic context engineering and significantly outperforming standard LLMs on long-document QA, chat memory, and deep research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack agency to actively manage their own memory/context, passively accepting manually engineered context within fixed architectural windows, analogous to Dumbledore having a Pensieve but no wand to operate it.

Method: Introduces StateLM, a new class of foundation models with internal reasoning loops equipped with memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking) and trained to actively manage these tools to dynamically engineer its own context.

Result: StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales on long-document QA; achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks; and show dramatic improvements on BrowseComp-Plus deep research task (52% vs ~5% for standard LLMs).

Conclusion: StateLM shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process, breaking free from the architectural constraints of fixed context windows.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reflections and coordinating length penalties with problem complexity, achieving significant reductions in response length while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate excessively long chains-of-thought with substantial reflections (repetitive self-questioning, circular reasoning) that increase token consumption, computational overhead, and latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models. Problem complexity exacerbates this issue, reducing accuracy while increasing token overhead.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a reinforcement learning framework with two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. These coordinated penalties encourage more concise and effective reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluated on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models. For the 1.5B model: 53.1% reduction in average response length with 5.8% accuracy improvement. For the 7B model: 35.0% reduction in length with 2.7% accuracy gain. Achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ARLCP effectively addresses the problem of excessive reflection in Large Reasoning Models by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy through adaptive penalties, enabling more concise reasoning paths without sacrificing (and often improving) accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

TL;DR: TSFMs with leakage-safe covariates and IOCI perform comparably to classical methods in data-sparse enrollment forecasting without institution-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and need accurate enrollment forecasts, but traditional methods struggle with short annual data series, reporting changes, and structural breaks in higher education contexts.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting with compact, leakage-safe covariates; introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) derived from documentary evidence and Google Trends demand proxies with stabilizing feature engineering; use expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

Conclusion: TSFMs with carefully constructed leakage-safe covariates and regime indicators like IOCI provide viable zero-shot alternatives to classical methods for data-sparse institutional enrollment forecasting.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLA (Hadamard Linear Attention) is a new linear attention variant that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (like softmax attention) rather than separately to queries/keys, resulting in higher-degree rational approximation of softmax with efficient computation similar to standard linear attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers has high computational cost, especially for applications with large token counts like video generation. Existing linear attention methods apply kernel functions independently to inputs before similarity calculation, resulting in low-degree rational approximations of softmax that may limit expressiveness.

Method: Proposed Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (analogous to standard softmax attention) rather than separately to queries and keys. This yields a higher-degree rational function approximation of softmax. The method provides an efficient computational scheme similar to standard linear attention without requiring time-consuming tensor reshaping operations.

Result: HLA demonstrates effectiveness when applied to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application involving very large amounts of tokens. The method maintains computational efficiency while providing a more expressive attention mechanism through higher-degree rational approximation of softmax.

Conclusion: HLA offers a novel approach to linear attention that better preserves the structure of standard softmax attention by applying nonlinearity after similarity computation, resulting in improved expressiveness while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale applications like video generation.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commercial image generators Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT Image 1.5 exhibit strong demographic biases despite neutral prompts, with both showing "default white" bias (>96%) but diverging on gender preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone biases in widely deployed models.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts across both models. Employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales.

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models exhibited strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender - Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing underlying biases. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework measuring how alignment interventions reshape interconnected value systems beyond target values, revealing systemic alignment risks invisible to conventional evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment work treats values statically, ignoring how interventions (prompting, fine-tuning, preference optimization) reshape the broader value system and propagate changes across interconnected values.

Method: Introduced Value Alignment Tax (VAT) framework to measure alignment-induced changes across interconnected values relative to on-target gain. Used controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, collected paired pre-post normative judgments, and analyzed alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: The VAT framework offers new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs by capturing how alignment pressure reshapes value expression across interconnected value systems, highlighting the need to consider systemic effects beyond target values.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: STAR is a framework that combines statistical expectations with knowledge-driven reasoning to predict large model performance from limited observations, outperforming existing methods under extreme data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive evaluation of large models is prohibitively expensive, and existing methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR bridges data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning using specialized retrievers for external knowledge, embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) for statistical expectations with uncertainty, and employs a reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) for refinement through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity with only 1-2 observed scores per test model.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses the challenges of predicting model performance from limited observations by combining statistical and knowledge-driven approaches, providing traceable explanations and robust performance under extreme data sparsity conditions.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty.

*Mahdi Khodabandeh,Ghazal Shabani,Arash Yousefi Jordehi,Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with T5 architecture that compresses data into token sequences rather than dense vectors, achieving higher compression ratios while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data structures, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for compression methods that preserve data format while achieving better compression ratios.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning applied to T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences. Employs off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimizing redundancy. Works independently of external grammatical or world knowledge by leveraging latent information in language models.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods while maintaining semantic integrity. The approach effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding.

Conclusion: The RL-based token sequence compression method offers a robust and practical solution for lossless compression across various applications, preserving data structure while achieving superior compression efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

*John Muchovej,Amanda Royka,Shane Lee,Julian Jara-Ettinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show social task proficiency but lack a coherent, domain-general Theory of Mind when tested with cognitively-grounded evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) - specifically, whether they have causal models of mental states and behavior rather than just performing well on social benchmarks.

Method: Developed a cognitively-grounded evaluation framework that probes whether LLMs have coherent, domain-general, and consistent models of how mental states cause behavior, testing them on logically equivalent tasks and measuring consistency between action predictions and mental state inferences.

Result: LLMs succeed at approximating human judgments in simple ToM paradigms but fail at logically equivalent tasks and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Conclusion: The social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind, suggesting they lack genuine causal models of mental states and behavior.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sci-CoE is a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve as both solver and verifier, transitioning from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning to enhance scientific reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs remain fragile in scientific reasoning tasks due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies, despite showing promise in other domains like code and math.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Uses small annotated dataset to establish correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier; 2) Introduces geometric reward mechanism considering consensus, reliability, and diversity to drive large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate enhanced complex reasoning capabilities and strong scalability, facilitating construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE successfully addresses limitations in scientific reasoning by enabling models to self-evolve through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning, improving both solver and verifier capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

### [68] [Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170)
*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks (QBBNs) with negation/backward reasoning and adds a typed slot grammar for natural language parsing, creating a hybrid LLM-grammar-QBBN architecture for formal semantic parsing and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two gaps from previous QBBN work: lack of negation/backward reasoning capabilities and absence of natural language parsing. Aims to reconcile formal semantics with modern LLM capabilities by creating a hybrid system where LLMs handle annotation/disambiguation while QBBNs provide structured inference.

Method: 1. Extends QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning via backward lambda messages. 2. Develops typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness. 3. Creates typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form. 4. Implements hybrid architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.

Result: QBBN engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. Grammar achieves 33/33 correct parses with zero ambiguity. LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy for disambiguation but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming grammar necessity.

Conclusion: Successfully integrates formal semantics with LLM capabilities, addressing Sutton's "bitter lesson" by using LLMs to eliminate annotation bottlenecks while QBBNs provide verifiable structured inference. The hybrid architecture demonstrates that grammars remain necessary for precise parsing despite LLM advances.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IOA framework applies educational principles (Bloom's Mastery Learning, Vygotsky's ZPD) to LLM knowledge distillation via a three-stage pipeline that systematically identifies knowledge gaps, organizes progressive curricula, and adapts representations to student capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process, failing to account for how students learn effectively.

Method: Three-stage IOA pipeline: 1) Knowledge Identifier detects student model deficiencies, 2) Organizer creates progressive curricula using educational principles, 3) Adapter adjusts representations to match student cognitive capacity. Integrates Bloom's Mastery Learning (master prerequisite knowledge before advancing) and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (controlled difficulty increments).

Result: Student models achieve 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval using <1/10th parameters. Significant improvements on complex reasoning: 19.2% on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared to SOTA baselines. Tested with LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as students.

Conclusion: Pedagogically-inspired distillation framework (IOA) significantly outperforms existing methods by systematically applying educational principles to knowledge transfer, particularly excelling in complex reasoning tasks while maintaining high parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder size by 88% while maintaining segmentation performance by replacing SAM3's large text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation, based on analysis showing severe redundancy in segmentation prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large, general-purpose text encoders designed for open-ended language understanding, but segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead from over-provisioned text encoder capacity.

Method: Conducted large-scale anatomical analysis of 404,796 real segmentation prompts across multiple benchmarks, revealing severe redundancy in context window utilization, vocabulary usage, and text embedding dimensionality. Proposed SAM3-LiteText framework that replaces original SAM3 text encoder with compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to original SAM3 model across image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals significant redundancy in text encoding for segmentation tasks, enabling development of lightweight text encoding frameworks that maintain performance while dramatically reducing computational and memory overhead, making vision-language segmentation models more efficient and practical.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes utterances like U.S. street names, with 44% error rate, disproportionately affecting non-English speakers. Synthetic data generation with TTS models improves accuracy by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognition systems achieve low WER on benchmarks but fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments, particularly for linguistically diverse speakers in critical applications like street name transcription.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from major providers on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers' street name recordings. Introduced synthetic data generation approach using open-source TTS models to produce diverse pronunciations of named entities, then fine-tuned with <1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% on street names. Mis-transcriptions cause systematic errors for all speakers, with routing distance errors twice as large for non-English primary speakers. Fine-tuning with synthetic data improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Conclusion: Highlights critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems. Demonstrates simple, scalable path to reduce high-stakes transcription errors through synthetic data generation and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics scientific reasoning by first inferring physical properties like symmetries, then using these as priors to guide symbolic regression for equation discovery from data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems for symbolic equation discovery directly guess equations from data without modeling the multi-step scientific reasoning process that involves first inferring physical properties (like symmetries) and then using these as priors to constrain the equation search space.

Method: KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structural information (physical properties), then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines (PySINDy, PySR) by setting their function libraries and structural constraints based on the inferred physical priors.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data compared to both LLM baselines and traditional methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the scientific reasoning process (inferring physical properties first, then using them as priors) in an agentic framework significantly improves symbolic equation discovery performance over direct equation guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards for training multi-turn, multi-step AI agents, using fine-grained binary criteria and LLM-simulated environments to achieve scalable optimization without heavy engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for AI agents face three key challenges: 1) realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, 2) RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is underexplored, and 3) building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage.

Method: CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into classification-style decisions. It uses sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria, and trains in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment to avoid heavy engineering for large tool sets.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, demonstrating consistent improvements over supervised fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage compared to uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance but has limitations for multi-step agentic tasks: small per-step errors compound over long horizons, and uniform compute allocation shows diminishing returns. Current methods lack understanding of how to efficiently allocate compute in multi-step environments.

Method: The paper presents CATTS (Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling), which uses uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) to dynamically allocate compute. Instead of uniform scaling, CATTS allocates compute only when decisions are contentious, using vote-derived uncertainty as a practical signal for compute allocation.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. The method shows that vote-derived uncertainty correlates with downstream success and provides an interpretable decision rule for compute allocation.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware test-time scaling using vote-derived uncertainty is an effective approach for multi-step agents, providing both efficiency gains and performance improvements over uniform scaling methods. The technique offers an interpretable way to allocate compute dynamically based on decision contention.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian filtering framework for UAV navigation that addresses state drift by decoupling navigation into prior prediction and likelihood correction using attention-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models for UAVs suffer from accumulated position errors over time due to dead-reckoning approaches, leading to state drift that compromises full trajectory prediction accuracy.

Method: Formulates sequential prediction as recursive Bayesian state estimation, decoupling navigation into Prior Prediction (based on motion dynamics) and Likelihood Correction (from historical observation). Associates Kernel Density Estimation of measurement likelihood with attention-based retrieval to rectify latent representations without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark show clear outperformance over strong baselines with only 10% of training data fine-tuning, effectively regulating drift accumulation.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman successfully addresses state drift in UAV navigation by integrating Bayesian filtering principles with neural networks, enabling more robust continuous navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution, where traditional methods may fail due to distributional drift.

Method: Uses weighted conformal prediction with learned state-control-dependent covariance to derive high-confidence model error bounds, integrated into system level synthesis-based robust nonlinear MPC with constraint tightening via volume-optimized forward reachable sets.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, with empirical demonstrations on 4D car and 12D quadcopter systems showing improved safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside data distribution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses out-of-distribution robustness for learned dynamics models by combining conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification with system level synthesis for robust control, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

TL;DR: CoVer introduces test-time verification with contrastive verification and hierarchical inference to reduce intention-action gaps in Vision-Language-Action models, achieving significant performance gains through test-time scaling and boot-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for general-purpose robots, there remains a significant "intention-action gap" where generated actions misalign with natural language instructions. Current approaches lack effective test-time verification mechanisms to ensure instruction-action alignment.

Method: Proposes CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment. Introduces test-time scaling laws showing joint scaling of rephrased instructions and generated actions improves sample diversity. Implements "boot-time compute" with hierarchical verification: precomputing diverse instruction rephrasings from a VLM, generating multiple action candidates per instruction, then using the verifier to select optimal high-level prompts and low-level action chunks.

Result: 22% in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution gains on SIMPLER benchmark compared to scaling policy pre-training alone. Additional 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On PolaRiS benchmark: 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate. Demonstrates graceful scaling with computational resources and data.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with CoVer effectively reduces intention-action gaps in VLA models. The hierarchical verification framework with boot-time compute provides a scalable approach to improve instruction-action alignment, offering significant performance improvements across benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

TL;DR: H-WM is a hierarchical world model that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions, combining symbolic reasoning's long-horizon robustness with visual grounding to mitigate error accumulation in robotic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for robotics either focus on video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional symbolic planning methods operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with a bilevel framework: high-level logical world model for symbolic reasoning and low-level visual world model for perceptual grounding. The model jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified framework, providing stable intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach. The hierarchical outputs mitigate error accumulation and enable robust execution across extended task sequences.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully integrates robot-executable symbolic reasoning with visual grounding, addressing limitations of existing approaches by providing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction for robust long-horizon robotic planning.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

### [79] [ExtremControl: Low-Latency Humanoid Teleoperation with Direct Extremity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11321)
*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that bypasses full-body retargeting, uses Cartesian-space mapping of human motion to selected humanoid links, and incorporates velocity feedforward control to achieve end-to-end latency as low as 50ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily humanoid extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid link targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level for responsiveness under rapidly changing control interfaces.

Result: The system achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms, substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit of prior work, and enables highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides a low-latency teleoperation framework that enables highly responsive humanoid behaviors previously impossible with existing approaches, opening possibilities for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless environmental variations underrepresented in existing benchmarks, necessitating infrastructure at scale and diversity beyond physical evaluation capabilities.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments (handcrafted to procedurally generated), 130k annotated objects (48k manipulable with 42M grasps), simulator-agnostic support (MuJoCo, Isaac, ManiSkill), and MolmoSpaces-Bench with 8 tasks covering static/mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks.

Result: MolmoSpaces-Bench shows strong sim-to-real correlation (R=0.96, ρ=0.98), confirms newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions, identifies sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion, and provides foundation for scalable robot learning research.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a comprehensive open ecosystem for large-scale robot policy benchmarking, enabling scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation to address real-world deployment challenges through diverse simulation environments and tasks.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

*Mrinal Verghese,Christopher G. Atkeson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot learning method that extracts human preferences from egocentric videos by modeling object motion prediction as a reward function, then optimizes robot policies using modified SAC initialized with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on learning rewards from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value as temporal distance to terminal states, make restrictive assumptions, and struggle with embodiment/environment transfer gaps. There's a need for more effective reward learning from human videos that works directly on robots.

Method: 1) Learn human preferences by predicting motion of tracked points between subsequent images; 2) Define reward as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior; 3) Use modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) initialized with only 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function; 4) Optimize policy to maximize this value function entirely on the robot.

Result: The approach successfully learns on real robots. Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the embodiment gap by learning human preferences through motion prediction and directly optimizing robot policies with minimal demonstrations, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

TL;DR: EasyMimic is a low-cost imitation learning framework that enables robots to learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations using standard RGB cameras, reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of collecting large-scale real-world robot data hinders imitation learning, especially for low-cost home robots that need to be both user-friendly and affordable.

Method: Extracts 3D hand trajectories from human videos, maps them to robot gripper control space via action alignment, uses hand visual augmentation to bridge domain gap, and employs co-training with both human and limited robot data for rapid adaptation.

Result: Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform show EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks while significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: EasyMimic offers a practical, low-cost solution for bringing intelligent robots into homes by enabling rapid learning from human demonstrations with minimal robot-specific data requirements.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A planning framework that integrates object search with task planning using novel LIOS actions, enabling robots to plan when object locations are unknown while maintaining compatibility with existing solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning assumes full environment knowledge, making approaches like PDDL ineffective when object locations are unknown. While learning-driven object search methods exist, they operate as standalone tools and cannot be easily integrated into full task planners that need to determine both what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions. Each LIOS action is a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic, using model-based calculations of expected cost to generate plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: The approach enables effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. It outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world tasks including retrieval and meal preparation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers, bridging the gap between traditional task planning and learning-driven object search methods.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet is a detector-agnostic framework that refines 4D radar point clouds to make them compatible with standard LiDAR-oriented 3D detectors through multi-frame aggregation, cross-sensor validation, and foreground-focused diffusion with mixed supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar offers weather robustness and cost advantages over LiDAR, but radar-only 3D detection lags behind LiDAR-based systems due to sparse, irregular, noisy point clouds with weak geometry that are incompatible with existing LiDAR-oriented detectors.

Method: HyperDet constructs task-aware hyper 4D radar point clouds by: 1) aggregating returns from multiple surround-view radars over consecutive frames, 2) applying geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks, and 3) integrating a foreground-focused diffusion module with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision, distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves detection performance over raw radar inputs with both VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint detectors, partially narrowing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR-based systems.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar point clouds to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, demonstrating that radar-only 3D detection can be improved through preprocessing rather than detector redesign.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

Motivation: The field of embodied navigation has been fragmented by task-specific architectures, creating inefficiencies and limiting generalization. The authors aim to unify multiple navigation tasks under a single foundation model to overcome these limitations and enable more robust, generalizable navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: ABot-N0 successfully demonstrates that a unified foundation model can outperform specialized architectures across multiple embodied navigation tasks. The integration of a planner with hierarchical topological memory enables robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments, representing significant progress toward general-purpose embodied AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile approaches focus on feature alignment with simple concatenation, struggling with occluded scenarios due to insufficient exploitation of modality complementarity and alignment, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS incorporates Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and a CVAE module to utilize both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations for guiding agent behavior.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework for visuo-tactile fusion that better handles occluded scenarios by properly leveraging modality alignment and complementarity.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attentive curriculum learning, demonstrating superior performance in cooperative navigation tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: Existing Human-Object Interaction methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor to estimate high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) from proprioceptive history, projects predictions onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a unified framework for robust interaction with diverse object dynamics using only proprioceptive sensing, enabling humanoid robots to handle underactuated objects with independent dynamics in complex environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that uses implicit neural fields to encode language features, enabling efficient coarse-to-fine path planning with gradient-based optimization for precise goal-reaching in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods using explicit language vector storage in grid/node-based maps suffer from excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning, especially when scaling to large environments.

Method: LAMP learns a continuous, language-driven map using implicit neural fields to encode language features, combines this with a sparse graph for coarse path planning, performs gradient-based optimization for pose refinement near goals, uses Bayesian framework with von Mises-Fisher distribution for embedding uncertainty, and employs graph sampling for spatial coverage and embedding confidence.

Result: LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy in experiments conducted in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor building environments.

Conclusion: The neural language field approach with implicit representations and coarse-to-fine planning enables scalable, memory-efficient zero-shot navigation with precise goal-reaching capabilities, addressing limitations of explicit storage methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies have limited generalization in semantic manipulation tasks because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate for directing policy attention to target objects in complex, dynamic environments.

Method: 1) Proposes bounding-box instruction to directly specify target objects; 2) Designs Label-UMI, a handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline for efficient demonstration data collection; 3) Develops a semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection with bounding-box guided diffusion policy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses generalization limitations in semantic manipulation, demonstrates data scaling laws exist in this domain, and provides an effective data collection strategy with strong performance on both seen and unseen objects.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

TL;DR: FAST is a humanoid whole-body control framework that enables fast adaptation to new motions and stable tracking through Parseval-guided residual policy adaptation and center-of-mass-aware control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid control approaches struggle with motion diversity, slow adaptation, and balance maintenance in dynamic scenarios, often requiring task-specific training or suffering performance degradation when adapting to new motions.

Method: FAST introduces two key components: 1) Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation that learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints for efficient adaptation while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and 2) Center-of-Mass-Aware Control that incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance during challenging motion tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that addresses key challenges in motion adaptation and balance maintenance, offering improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

*Yu Deng,Yufeng Jin,Xiaogang Jia,Jiahong Xue,Gerhard Neumann,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from diffusion models into deterministic vision backbones for robot manipulation, addressing the structural mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and fine-grained control requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision backbones for robot manipulation suffer from a structural mismatch: they optimize for semantic invariance (good for classification) but manipulation requires geometric sensitivity to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. This creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control.

Method: Proposes Robot-DIFT framework using Manifold Distillation to decouple geometric information from inference. Distills frozen diffusion teacher (which inherently encodes geometric dependencies) into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), retaining geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift.

Result: Pretrained on large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is structural mismatch between vision backbones and physical control requirements. Robot-DIFT successfully bridges this gap by distilling geometric priors from diffusion models into deterministic networks, enabling better manipulation performance through geometrically-sensitive visual representations.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate RL training for robot manipulation, improving sample efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-in-the-Loop RL methods for robot manipulation suffer from scalability limitations due to 1:1 supervision ratio, operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency, creating barriers to fleet expansion and efficient training.

Method: AGPS uses a multimodal agent as a semantic world model that injects intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. The agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints using executable tools, automating the supervision pipeline.

Result: AGPS outperforms Human-in-the-Loop methods in sample efficiency on tasks ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation, demonstrating automated supervision without human intervention.

Conclusion: AGPS automates the robot learning supervision pipeline, enabling labor-free and scalable training by replacing human supervisors with multimodal agents, unlocking the path to fleet-scale robot learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF approaches have limitations: open-loop planners generate fixed trajectories that struggle with disturbances, while closed-loop heuristics lack reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments like automated warehouses.

Method: ACCBS builds on a finite-horizon variant of CBS (Conflict-Based Search) with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. It dynamically adjusts planning horizon based on computational budget and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons.

Result: ACCBS produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies show it combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees.

Conclusion: ACCBS effectively bridges the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment in automated warehouses and logistics.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

*Jingxian Lu,Wenke Xia,Yuxuan Wu,Zhiwu Lu,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates inconsistent generalization in vision-proprioception policies, identifies that proprioception dominates during motion-transition phases, and proposes GAP algorithm to modulate proprioception gradients for better visual modality learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show inconsistent observations on generalization of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation. Proprioception is critical for servo control, and its collaboration with vision is expected to enhance manipulation performance, but inconsistent generalization patterns need investigation.

Method: Conducted temporally controlled experiments revealing proprioception dominates during motion-transition phases. Proposed Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that: 1) uses proprioception to estimate probability of timesteps belonging to motion-transition phases, 2) applies fine-grained gradient magnitude reduction for proprioception based on estimated probabilities to enable dynamic collaboration between vision and proprioception.

Result: GAP enables robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into vision-proprioception policy development by addressing proprioception dominance during motion-transition phases through adaptive gradient modulation, enabling effective multimodal collaboration in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollout collection is expensive, and existing world models lack physical fidelity for policy improvement due to limited demonstration datasets and poor modeling of contact-rich manipulation details.

Method: Proposes an iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world rollout data to enhance world model fidelity, which then generates supplemental synthetic data for VLA model training.

Result: Achieves 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of world models using real-world data enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, demonstrating significant performance gains on downstream robotic tasks.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Conclusion: AGT-World provides a unified framework for autonomous construction of interactive simulated environments and robot policies, enabling scalable robot learning through structured task decomposition and self-evolution with hybrid feedback.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation requires efficient bin-packing, but existing methods focus on empty containers and collision-free strategies, ignoring real-world scenarios where containers are partially filled with suboptimal arrangements due to transportation

Method: Contact-aware packing using contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within model predictive controller, integrated with physics-aware perception system for pose estimation during occlusions, and method for suggesting physically-feasible placement locations

Result: Enables successful placement of new items into partially filled containers by exploiting purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space

Conclusion: Proposed approach addresses practical warehouse bin-packing challenges by enabling manipulation of existing items to create space, moving beyond traditional collision-free strategies for empty containers

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

Conclusion: MGS provides an efficient motion planning solution for high-dimensional robotic systems that addresses the limitations of existing approaches while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: 3DGSNav is a zero-shot object navigation framework that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for vision-language models to enhance spatial reasoning, achieving robust performance across benchmarks and real-world robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods rely on scene abstractions (semantic maps or textual representations) that constrain high-level decision making by low-level perception accuracy. There's a need for better spatial reasoning capabilities in embodied AI agents.

Method: The framework incrementally constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation of the environment through active perception, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. It uses structured visual prompts with Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve VLM reasoning, real-time object detection for target filtering, and VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav successfully integrates 3DGS as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning in zero-shot object navigation, providing a more effective framework that overcomes limitations of scene abstraction methods.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient deformation gaits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric framework for understanding and optimizing locomotion efficiency in slender bodies (like snakes and robots) that move by changing shape, accounting for both environmental drag and internal energy costs of shape changes.

Method: Formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics, with continuous model and consistent discretization for numerical computation of optimal deformation gaits under various boundary conditions.

Result: The model successfully computes optimal deformation gaits that qualitatively match observed biological motions (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results for low-dimensional systems like Purcell's swimmers, while providing new insights into generalized locomotion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The geometric sub-Riemannian framework provides a flexible and comprehensive approach to modeling and optimizing shape-change-induced locomotion, capturing overall efficiency by including both external and internal energy dissipation, with applications to biological understanding and robotic design.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, outperforming prior methods on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models rely heavily on behavior cloning which discards transferable dynamics knowledge in heterogeneous embodied data. While Unified World Models (UWM) could leverage such diverse data, existing implementations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at 1B-parameter scale. It uses prediction in a structured DINO latent space to avoid redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. The model assigns distinct roles to data of varying quality and is trained on EI-30k, a standardized embodied interaction dataset with over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories.

Result: LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. It enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% performance improvement by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories that are typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates that scalable robot foundation models can be built through universal embodied data ingestion with proper handling of heterogeneous data quality and structured latent representations, enabling both strong zero-shot performance and data-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AHAT is a household task planning system that combines LLMs with symbolic reasoning to handle long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions, using a novel RL algorithm (TGPO) to improve instruction decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability as performance degrades with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity in open-world household settings.

Method: AHAT uses an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded PDDL subgoals, which are then solved via symbolic reasoning. It introduces TGPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization to enhance complex intention decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly excelling in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Conclusion: The combination of LLM-based instruction decomposition with symbolic reasoning through PDDL planning creates an effective solution for scalable, long-horizon household task planning that handles ambiguous human instructions better than existing approaches.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

*Seungyeon Yoo,Youngseok Jang,Dabin Kim,Youngsoo Han,Seungwoo Jung,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go is a real-to-sim pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic navigation datasets by combining static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes with animatable human avatars, enabling training of robust navigation policies for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models face challenges in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific target environments. Existing real-to-sim approaches using 3D Gaussian Splatting assume only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic settings.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator integrating static scene GS with human animation module for inserting animatable human GS avatars and synthesizing plausible human motions from 2D trajectories; (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator, robot expert planner for dynamic GS representations, and human planner; (3) Policy learning using generated datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in presence of moving obstacles. Zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environment demonstrates generalization potential.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go successfully addresses limitations of existing real-to-sim approaches by generating photorealistic dynamic scenarios, enabling training of robust navigation policies that handle both sim-to-real gaps and moving obstacles in real-world environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.
