### [1] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Continuous Navigation via Memory-Augmented Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11183)
*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian filtering framework for UAV navigation that addresses state drift by decoupling navigation into prior prediction and likelihood correction using attention-based retrieval, outperforming baselines with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Navigation models for UAVs suffer from accumulated position errors (state drift) due to dead-reckoning approaches, where stepwise position updates lead to misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, compromising full trajectory prediction.

Method: Formulates sequential prediction as recursive Bayesian state estimation, decoupling navigation into: 1) Prior Prediction based on motion dynamics, and 2) Likelihood Correction from historical observation. Mathematically associates Kernel Density Estimation of measurement likelihood with attention-based retrieval mechanism, allowing system to rectify latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that with only 10% of training data fine-tuning, the method clearly outperforms strong baselines and effectively regulates drift accumulation.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman provides an effective Bayesian filtering framework for UAV navigation that addresses the critical problem of state drift by combining motion dynamics with historical observation correction, achieving superior performance with minimal fine-tuning requirements.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

### [2] [H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291)
*Wenyuan Chen,Jinbang Huang,Oscar Pang,Zhiyuan Li,Xiao Hu,Lingfeng Zhang,Zhanguang Zhang,Mark Coates,Tongtong Cao,Xingyue Quan,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-WM: A hierarchical world model that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions for robust long-horizon robotic planning, combining symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for robotics either focus on video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors. Traditional symbolic planning methods operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with a bilevel framework: high-level logical world model for symbolic reasoning and low-level visual world model for perceptual grounding. The model jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions, providing stable intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks. Trained on a robotic dataset aligning robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach. The hierarchical outputs mitigate error accumulation and enable robust execution across extended task sequences.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully integrates robot-executable symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding, addressing limitations of existing world models by providing synchronized symbolic and visual state prediction for robust long-horizon robotic planning.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

### [3] [ExtremControl: Low-Latency Humanoid Teleoperation with Direct Extremity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11321)
*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that bypasses full-body retargeting by operating directly on SE(3) poses of selected links, uses Cartesian-space mapping, and incorporates velocity feedforward control to achieve end-to-end latency as low as 50ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency (200ms+) due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid link targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces.

Result: The system achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms (substantially surpassing the 200ms limit of prior work) and enables highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides an effective low-latency framework for humanoid teleoperation that enables highly responsive behaviors previously unattainable with existing approaches, with applications in collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MolmoSpaces is an open ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments and 130k annotated objects for large-scale robot policy benchmarking, featuring simulator-agnostic support and strong sim-to-real correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless environmental variations underrepresented in existing benchmarks, necessitating infrastructure at scale beyond physical evaluation capabilities.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces with 230k+ diverse indoor environments (handcrafted and procedurally generated), 130k annotated objects (48k manipulable with 42M grasps), simulator-agnostic support (MuJoCo, Isaac, ManiSkill), and MolmoSpaces-Bench benchmark suite with 8 tasks.

Result: Demonstrated strong sim-to-real correlation (R=0.96, ρ=0.98), confirmed newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions, identified sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research through its open-source assets and tooling.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

### [5] [Human Preference Modeling Using Visual Motion Prediction Improves Robot Skill Learning from Egocentric Human Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11393)
*Mrinal Verghese,Christopher G. Atkeson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot learning method that models human preferences from egocentric videos by predicting object motion and using this as a reward function, optimized on-robot with SAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on reward learning from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value as temporal distance to terminal state, make restrictive assumptions, and struggle with embodiment/environment transfer. There's a need for better methods that can learn directly from human videos and transfer effectively to robots.

Method: Learn human preferences by predicting motion of tracked points between subsequent images. Define reward as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior. Use modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function from this reward and optimize policy, all executed on the robot.

Result: Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on real robots. The approach is capable of learning directly on a real robot.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the embodiment gap by learning human preferences from videos through motion prediction, enabling effective robot learning that outperforms previous approaches.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

### [6] [EasyMimic: A Low-Cost Framework for Robot Imitation Learning from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11464)
*Tao Zhang,Song Xia,Ye Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EasyMimic enables low-cost robots to learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations using 3D hand trajectory extraction, action alignment, visual augmentation, and co-training with minimal robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of collecting large-scale real-world robot data hinders imitation learning, especially for affordable home robots that need to be user-friendly and cost-effective.

Method: Extracts 3D hand trajectories from RGB videos, maps them to robot gripper control via action alignment, uses hand visual augmentation to bridge domain gap, and employs co-training with both human and limited robot data.

Result: Achieves high performance on low-cost LeRobot platform across various manipulation tasks, significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: Provides practical, low-cost solution for robot imitation learning from human demonstrations, enabling intelligent robots to be more accessible for home use.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

### [7] [Effective Task Planning with Missing Objects using Learning-Informed Object Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11468)
*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A planning framework that integrates object search policies (LIOS actions) into task planning to handle unknown object locations while maintaining compatibility with existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning assumes full environment knowledge and cannot handle unknown object locations, while standalone learning-driven search approaches cannot be easily integrated into comprehensive task planners that need to determine what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops a planning framework with novel model-based LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions - each a policy for finding and retrieving a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic, informed by model-based calculations of expected search costs, generating plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: The approach outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world scenarios on tasks including object retrieval and meal preparation, providing effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers, enabling robust task planning in environments with unknown object locations through integrated search and execution planning.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

### [8] [HyperDet: 3D Object Detection with Hyper 4D Radar Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11554)
*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet is a detector-agnostic framework that refines sparse 4D radar point clouds through multi-frame aggregation, cross-sensor consensus validation, and foreground-focused diffusion to enable radar-only 3D detection using standard LiDAR-oriented detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar offers weather robustness and cost advantages over LiDAR, but radar-only 3D detection underperforms due to sparse, irregular point clouds corrupted by multipath noise, resulting in weak geometry that standard LiDAR detectors cannot effectively process.

Method: 1) Aggregates returns from multiple surround-view radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage/density; 2) Applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks outside overlap regions to suppress noise; 3) Integrates foreground-focused diffusion module with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision during training to densify object structures and enhance radar attributes; 4) Distills model into consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves detection performance over raw radar inputs when used with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint detectors, partially narrowing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR-based systems.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar point clouds to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, demonstrating that radar-only 3D detection can be improved through preprocessing rather than detector redesign.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

### [9] [ReaDy-Go: Real-to-Sim Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting Simulation for Environment-Specific Visual Navigation with Moving Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11575)
*Seungyeon Yoo,Youngseok Jang,Dabin Kim,Youngsoo Han,Seungwoo Jung,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go is a real-to-sim pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic navigation datasets by combining static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes with animatable human avatars, enabling training of robust navigation policies for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models face challenges in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific deployment environments. Existing real-to-sim approaches using 3D Gaussian Splatting assume static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic settings.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator integrating scene GS with human animation module for inserting animatable human GS avatars and synthesizing plausible human motions from 2D trajectories; (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator, a robot expert planner for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner; (3) Policy learning using the generated datasets.

Result: ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environments demonstrates generalization potential.

Conclusion: The proposed ReaDy-Go pipeline effectively addresses the limitations of existing real-to-sim approaches by enabling photorealistic dynamic scenario synthesis, resulting in more robust navigation policies that handle both sim-to-real gaps and moving obstacles in real-world environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models. Furthermore, our Agentic Navigation System integrates a planner with hierarchical topological memory, enabling robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.

*Yufeng Tian,Shuiqi Cheng,Tianming Wei,Tianxing Zhou,Yuanhang Zhang,Zixian Liu,Qianwei Han,Zhecheng Yuan,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTaS is a visuo-tactile robotic manipulation framework that uses Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning and CVAE to better exploit alignment and complementarity between visual and tactile modalities, especially in occluded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile approaches focus mainly on feature alignment and use simple concatenation, failing to effectively handle occluded scenarios by neglecting the complementary nature of modalities and under-exploiting alignment, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS framework with Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and CVAE module to utilize both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework for incorporating visual and tactile information in robotic manipulation by better exploiting modality alignment and complementarity.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

### [12] [Human-Like Gaze Behavior in Social Robots: A Deep Learning Approach Integrating Human and Non-Human Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11648)
*Faezeh Vahedi,Morteza Memari,Ramtin Tabatabaei,Alireza Taheri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops neural network models (LSTM and Transformer) to predict human gaze behavior in social interactions, including responses to non-human stimuli, and deploys the system on a NAO robot for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt their gaze behavior to enhance communication effectiveness in social interactions, requiring them to respond to both human and non-human stimuli, which has been underexplored in prior research.

Method: Collected gaze data from 41 participants using VR glasses in simulated scenarios (3D animation and 360-degree real-world video), preprocessed data, and trained LSTM and Transformer neural networks to predict gaze patterns. Deployed the system on a NAO robot and evaluated with 275 participants via questionnaire.

Result: LSTM achieved 67.6% accuracy in animated scenarios and 72% in real-world scenarios; Transformer achieved 70.4% in animated and 71.6% in real-world scenarios. The models outperform existing approaches and uniquely consider non-human stimuli. Questionnaire evaluation showed high satisfaction during robot interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts, including responses to non-human stimuli, improving communication effectiveness in social interactions.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attention mechanisms and structured curriculum learning, demonstrating superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

TL;DR: HAIC is a unified framework for humanoid robots to robustly interact with diverse underactuated objects using only proprioceptive sensing, without external state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Human-Object Interaction methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor to estimate high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) from proprioceptive history, projects these onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a unified framework for robust humanoid-object interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation, enabling successful completion of complex tasks involving underactuated objects with independent dynamics.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

*Sibaek Lee,Hyeonwoo Yu,Giseop Kim,Sunwook Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that learns continuous language-driven maps for efficient zero-shot navigation, outperforming explicit methods in memory efficiency and goal-reaching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle with scalability due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning in large environments.

Method: LAMP encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than explicit storage, combines this with a sparse graph for coarse path planning, performs gradient-based optimization for fine-grained refinement, uses Bayesian framework with von Mises-Fisher distribution for uncertainty modeling, and employs graph sampling for scalability.

Result: Experimental results in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor buildings demonstrate LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Conclusion: LAMP presents an effective neural language field-based approach that addresses scalability limitations of explicit methods through implicit representations, gradient-guided optimization, and uncertainty-aware Bayesian modeling for robust zero-shot navigation.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using bounding-box instructions instead of just text to improve diffusion-based policies for semantic manipulation in robotics, introduces an automated annotation pipeline for data collection, and discovers scaling laws between generalization performance and bounding-box object count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies for semantic manipulation show limited generalization in real-world robotics due to inadequate target object specification using only text instructions in complex environments.

Method: 1) Leverage bounding-box instructions to directly specify target objects; 2) Design Label-UMI - a handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline for efficient demonstration data collection; 3) Propose semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection with bounding-box guided diffusion policy.

Result: 1) Validated effectiveness through extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets; 2) Revealed power-law relationship between generalization performance and number of bounding-box objects; 3) Achieved 85% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

Conclusion: Bounding-box instructions significantly improve generalization in semantic manipulation, scaling laws exist for this task, and the proposed data collection strategy enables high success rates across diverse objects and tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid controllers struggle with motion diversity, slow adaptation, and balance robustness in dynamic scenarios, often requiring task-specific training or suffering performance degradation with new motions.

Method: FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation (learning lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints) and Center-of-Mass-Aware Control (incorporating CoM observations and objectives for balance).

Result: FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization in both simulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that enables fast adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while maintaining stable tracking and robust balance.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

*Yu Deng,Yufeng Jin,Xiaogang Jia,Jiahong Xue,Gerhard Neumann,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from frozen diffusion models into deterministic feature pyramids to address the structural mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and manipulation's need for geometric sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision encoders for robot manipulation optimize for semantic invariance, creating a "blind spot" for fine-grained control that requires geometric sensitivity to millimeter-level pose shifts. While diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies, their stochastic nature makes them unsuitable for real-time control.

Method: Proposes Robot-DIFT framework with Manifold Distillation: distills frozen diffusion teacher into deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN) to retain geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift.

Result: Pretrained on DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is structural mismatch between vision backbones and physical control requirements; Robot-DIFT bridges this gap by decoupling geometric information from inference via distillation of diffusion priors into deterministic feature pyramids.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

### [19] [When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032)
*Jingxian Lu,Wenke Xia,Yuxuan Wu,Zhiwu Lu,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-proprioception policies suffer from proprioceptive dominance during motion transitions, limiting visual learning; GAP algorithm modulates proprioception gradients based on phase probabilities to enable balanced multimodal collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioception is critical for robotic servo control, and its collaboration with vision is expected to enhance manipulation policy performance in complex tasks. However, inconsistent observations exist regarding the generalization of vision-proprioception policies, particularly during motion-transition phases where visual information should be important for target localization.

Method: The authors propose Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates proprioception optimization. It uses proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate probability of each timestep belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, fine-grained adjustment reduces proprioception gradient magnitude based on estimated probabilities, enabling dynamic collaboration within vision-proprioception policies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. The method enables robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies by preventing proprioceptive dominance during training.

Conclusion: Vision-proprioception policies naturally gravitate toward proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction, suppressing visual learning during motion-transition phases. GAP addresses this by adaptively modulating proprioception gradients based on phase probabilities, enabling effective multimodal collaboration. This work provides valuable insights for developing vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, analyzes data density and trajectory tube size effects, and empirically demonstrates improved safety and robustness on 4D car and 12D quadcopter systems compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables robust out-of-distribution planning and control by combining conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification with system level synthesis for robust constraint satisfaction, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements in safety.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollouts are expensive to collect, and existing world models lack physical fidelity for policy improvement due to limited demonstration datasets and poor modeling of contact-rich manipulation details.

Method: Proposed iterative improvement algorithm: use real-world rollout data to enhance world model fidelity, then use improved world model to generate synthetic data for VLA model training.

Result: Achieved 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative improvement using real-world data to enhance world model fidelity enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, addressing limitations of existing world models.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Conclusion: AGT-World provides a unified framework for autonomous construction of interactive simulated environments and robot policies, enabling scalable robot learning through structured task decomposition and self-evolution with hybrid feedback.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation requires efficient bin-packing, but existing methods focus on empty containers and collision avoidance, ignoring real-world scenarios where containers are partially filled with suboptimal arrangements due to warehouse transportation.

Method: Contact-aware packing approach using contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within model predictive controller, integrated with physics-aware perception system for pose estimation during occlusions, and method for suggesting physically-feasible placement locations.

Result: Enables successful placement of new items into partially filled containers by exploiting purposeful interactions with existing objects to create free space, overcoming limitations of collision-free strategies.

Conclusion: Proposed contact-aware approach addresses practical warehouse bin-packing challenges by allowing intentional object interactions to optimize space utilization in partially filled containers, advancing beyond traditional collision-avoidance methods.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for vision-language models. Incrementally constructs 3DGS representation through active perception, enables trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Combines structured visual prompts with Chain-of-Thought prompting for improved VLM reasoning. Uses real-time object detector for potential target filtering and VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav provides an effective framework for zero-shot object navigation that enhances spatial reasoning through 3DGS-based memory representation and improves navigation reliability through active perception and verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced locomotion using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient motions of slender bodies like snakes and spermatozoa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric framework for analyzing optimal locomotion of slender bodies where motion is determined by shape changes, accounting for both environmental drag and internal metabolic/actuator energy dissipation.

Method: Formulates Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics, with continuous model and consistent discretization for numerical computation of optimal deformation gaits under various boundary conditions.

Result: Optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed biological motions (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results for low-dimensional systems like Purcell's swimmers, providing new insights into locomotion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The geometric model successfully captures overall locomotion efficiency by considering both external and internal energy dissipation, offering a flexible framework for analyzing and optimizing shape-change-induced motions in biological and robotic systems.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, outperforming prior methods on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent robot foundation models rely on behavior cloning which discards transferable dynamics knowledge in heterogeneous embodied data. Unified World Models (UWM) have potential but struggle to scale due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: LDA-1B jointly learns dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting by assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. Uses structured DINO latent space for scalable dynamics learning to avoid redundant pixel-space modeling. Employs multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at 1B-parameter scale. Supported by EI-30k dataset with 30k hours of human/robot trajectories.

Result: Outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. Enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% improvement by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates scalable robot foundation modeling through universal embodied data ingestion, showing superior performance across diverse task types and enabling effective utilization of low-quality data that would normally be discarded.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

### [30] [Any House Any Task: Scalable Long-Horizon Planning for Abstract Human Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12244)
*Zhihong Liu,Yang Li,Rengming Huang,Cewu Lu,Panpan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AHAT is a household task planner that combines LLMs with symbolic reasoning for long-horizon planning in large environments, using TGPO reinforcement learning to handle ambiguous instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability in large household environments, degrading with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity.

Method: AHAT uses an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into PDDL subgoals, then performs symbolic reasoning for optimal planning. TGPO reinforcement learning integrates external correction of reasoning traces into GRPO to improve instruction decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, especially in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs for instruction understanding and symbolic reasoning for optimal planning, enhanced by TGPO reinforcement learning, provides an effective solution for scalable open-world household task planning.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

### [31] [Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281)
*Jacky Kwok,Xilun Zhang,Mengdi Xu,Yuejiang Liu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Chelsea Finn,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoVer introduces test-time verification with contrastive learning to reduce intention-action gaps in VLA models, achieving significant performance gains through hierarchical verification and boot-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Vision-Language-Action models, generated actions often misalign with instructions. The paper aims to shrink this "intention-action gap" through test-time verification.

Method: Introduces CoVer (contrastive verifier) with test-time scaling laws, boot-time compute, and hierarchical verification pipeline that precomputes rephrased instructions, generates action candidates, and selects optimal prompts/actions.

Result: 22% in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution gains on SIMPLER benchmark, 45% improvement in real-world experiments, 14% task progress and 9% success rate gains on PolaRiS benchmark.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with CoVer effectively reduces intention-action misalignment in VLA models, demonstrating that verification scales better than policy pre-training for embodied instruction following.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate robot reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency and scalability over human-in-the-loop methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for robot manipulation suffers from severe sample inefficiency. Human-in-the-loop methods accelerate training but face scalability limitations due to 1:1 supervision ratios, operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency.

Method: AGPS uses a multimodal agent as a semantic world model to inject intrinsic value priors, structuring physical exploration. The agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints using executable tools, automating the supervision pipeline.

Result: AGPS outperforms human-in-the-loop methods in sample efficiency across tasks including precision insertion and deformable object manipulation, demonstrating automated supervision that enables scalable robot learning.

Conclusion: AGPS automates the robot training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with multimodal agents, unlocking labor-free and scalable reinforcement learning for generalist manipulation skills.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

### [33] [Explaining AI Without Code: A User Study on Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11159)
*Natalia Abarca,Andrés Carvallo,Claudia López Moncada,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-centered XAI module was integrated into DashAI, a no-code ML platform, using PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. A user study showed high task success, with novices finding explanations useful and trustworthy, while experts were more critical of completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of ML in sensitive domains raises transparency concerns. While XAI addresses this, most methods require technical expertise, limiting accessibility for novices. This gap is critical in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI but rarely include explainability features.

Method: Developed a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. Integrated three complementary techniques: Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. Conducted a user study with N=20 participants (ML novices and experts) to evaluate usability and explanation impact.

Result: Results showed: (i) high task success (≥80%) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, α=0.74), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, α=0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML: making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts. The human-centered approach successfully integrated XAI into a no-code platform, demonstrating feasibility and identifying key user group differences in explanation perception.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Generative Solvers (LGS) is a two-stage framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that uses a pretrained VAE to map diverse PDE states into a shared latent space, then learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching, achieving 70× lower FLOPs than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems, particularly dealing with rollout drift in autoregressive prediction and enabling scalable pretraining for generalizable neural PDE solvers.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) pretrained VAE maps diverse PDE states into shared latent physics space, (2) Transformer learns probabilistic latent dynamics via flow matching. Key innovations: uncertainty knob for correcting off-manifold drift, flow forcing to update system descriptors from generated trajectories, pretraining on ~2.5M trajectories across 12 PDE families at 128² resolution.

Result: Matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. Shows efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow with limited finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows, combining efficiency, stability, and adaptability across diverse PDE systems.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecisionDB formalizes decision-valued maps to track how different data representations affect computational outcomes, enabling deterministic replay and audit of representation-preservation relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can produce different computational outcomes, creating a need to systematically track which representations preserve results versus change them, and to enable verifiable decision reuse.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate representations with discrete outcomes, implements DecisionDB infrastructure for logging, replaying, and auditing these relationships using content-derived identifiers and write-once artifact storage.

Result: Partitions representation space into persistence regions (where outcomes are preserved) and boundaries (where outcomes change), establishes deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers, and enables mechanically checkable decision reuse.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic treatment of representation-dependent computational outcomes, offering verifiable tracking of decision preservation across different data representations through formal decision-valued maps and auditable infrastructure.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current streaming ASR approaches often compromise quality by adapting offline models through chunking or sliding windows, resulting in suboptimal performance compared to offline systems. There's a need for natively streaming models that can achieve offline-level quality with low latency.

Method: The model uses the Delayed Streams Modeling framework with a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. It's trained end-to-end for streaming with explicit audio-text alignment, and scaled with pretraining on a large multilingual dataset spanning 13 languages.

Conclusion: End-to-end streaming training with proper architectural design enables ASR systems to achieve offline transcription quality with low latency, making high-quality real-time speech recognition practical. The model is released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency.

Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages.

*John M. Willis*

TL;DR: PBSAI introduces a multi-agent reference architecture for securing enterprise AI estates, organizing responsibilities into 12 domains with bounded agent families, shared context envelopes, and structured output contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises are rapidly deploying LLMs, RAG pipelines, and tool-using agents in production environments that also support defensive analytics, creating complex AI estates. Existing governance frameworks like NIST AI RMF provide principles but lack implementable architectures for multi-agent AI-enabled cyber defense.

Method: PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve-domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. It includes a lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem-level invariants to ensure traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees.

Result: The architecture demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrates application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. It provides structured, evidence-centric foundation for open ecosystem development.

Conclusion: PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence-centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation, addressing the gap between governance principles and implementable architectures for securing enterprise AI estates.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, revealing how consensus-seeking annotation practices erase human disagreement, impose Western norms, and propose pluralistic alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the foundational assumption in machine learning that "ground truth" labels represent objective correctness, arguing this paradigm treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than meaningful sociotechnical signal. It aims to expose how current data annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that erases cultural diversity and imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of 30,897 records from seven premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS) between 2020-2025. Used tiered keyword filtration to refine to 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Applied reflexive thematic analysis to identify systemic patterns in annotation practices.

Result: Revealed that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the shift toward human-as-verifier models and model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and remove human voices. Found geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, enforced by precarious data workers prioritizing requester compliance over honest subjectivity. Identified the "noisy sensor" fallacy where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error.

Conclusion: Argues for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for culturally competent models. Proposes a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift from discovering singular "right" answers to mapping the diversity of human experience, addressing systemic tensions in current ML practices.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

TL;DR: BLPO is a bi-level prompt optimization framework that improves multimodal LLM judges for evaluating AI-generated images by converting images to text representations and jointly optimizing both judge and image-to-text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI-generated content evaluation, but aligning them with human judgments remains challenging. Supervised fine-tuning is costly and inflexible, while existing auto prompt optimization methods focus on text-only evaluations and don't address multimodal limitations like context window constraints for visual examples.

Method: BLPO (Bi-Level Prompt Optimization) framework that converts images into textual representations preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Uses bi-level optimization to jointly refine the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving multimodal LLM-as-a-judge evaluations for AI-generated images.

Conclusion: BLPO provides an efficient alternative to supervised fine-tuning for improving multimodal LLM judges, overcoming context window limitations through bi-level optimization of prompts and image-to-text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench is a framework for systematically evaluating LLM-based agent robustness under realistic noisy environments, revealing performance gaps between benchmark and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents show strong benchmark performance but degrade in real-world deployments due to stochasticity and noise that existing training/evaluation paradigms overlook. There's a need to bridge this gap between idealized benchmarks and realistic noisy environments.

Method: 1) Analyze real-world biases/uncertainties and categorize noise into user-noise and tool-noise. 2) Develop automated pipeline to inject controllable noise into existing agent benchmarks while preserving task solvability. 3) Conduct extensive evaluations across diverse models with varying architectures and parameter scales.

Result: Reveals consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations. Shows discrepancy between benchmark performance and real-world robustness.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench provides a systematic framework for evaluating agent robustness under noise, exposing limitations of current models in handling real-world stochasticity and offering a pathway for developing more robust agentic systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement and regularization to train proactive LLM agents that balance task performance with user engagement in multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt efficiently to user intentions, while overuse of human feedback reduces user satisfaction.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (to suppress inefficient/redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations).

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite and achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents for complex multi-turn scenarios by addressing the trade-off between task performance and user engagement through combined behavior enhancement and regularization.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench: A benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to replicate scientific research, including both replicable and non-replicable claims, with focus on the full replication process rather than just outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI assessment of scientific papers focus primarily on computational reproduction with code/data access, but fail to capture real-world replication challenges like inconsistent data availability and lack ground-truth diversity by only including reproducible papers.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark with human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims from social/behavioral sciences, evaluating AI agents across three stages: data extraction/retrieval, computational experiment design/execution, and result interpretation. Also develops ReplicatorAgent framework with tools like web search and sandboxed environments.

Result: Evaluation of ReplicatorAgent across four LLMs shows current LLM agents can effectively design/execute computational experiments but struggle with retrieving necessary resources (like new data) for replication. Performance varies with programming language and code access levels.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by including non-replicable claims and evaluating the full replication process. Current LLM agents have significant limitations in resource retrieval for replication tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in AI research assessment capabilities.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA is an object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object representations, using object-level masking to force interaction reasoning and induce causal inductive biases, improving counterfactual reasoning and planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric representations alone are insufficient for capturing interaction-dependent dynamics in world models. Current approaches lack mechanisms to force relational understanding and prevent shortcut solutions in predicting object states.

Method: Extends masked joint embedding prediction (JEPA) from image patches to object-centric representations. Applies object-level masking that requires predicting a masked object's state from other objects, inducing latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and preventing shortcut solutions.

Result: Achieves ~20% absolute improvement in counterfactual reasoning for visual question answering compared to same architecture without object-level masking. Enables substantially more efficient planning on agent control tasks using only 1% of latent input features compared to patch-based world models while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: Object-level masking in C-JEPA provides an effective mechanism for inducing causal inductive biases through latent interventions, forcing interaction reasoning essential for robust relational understanding in world models, with demonstrated benefits for both reasoning and control tasks.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 models that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity degradation, addressing inference bottlenecks without requiring backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but creates substantial inference overhead during autoregressive generation, saturating bandwidth. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods are too costly.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) is a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. It jointly measures controllability and observability to rival gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation.

Result: On models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, GHOST achieves a 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an effective structured pruning solution for Mamba2 models that addresses inference bottlenecks while maintaining model fidelity, offering a practical alternative to gradient-based methods that doesn't require backpropagation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-using interactions that detects critical failure episodes by combining content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic/lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals in multi-turn tool-using interactions, where failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on the τ²-bench for predicting task failure and selective task execution, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: TRACER provides an effective trajectory-level uncertainty metric that captures critical failure episodes in multi-turn tool-using interactions, outperforming existing single-shot uncertainty proxies and enabling better failure prediction and selective execution.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

*Chengrui Qu,Christopher Yeh,Kishan Panaganti,Eric Mazumdar,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributionally Robust IGM (DrIGM), a robust version of the Individual-Global-Maximum principle for cooperative multi-agent RL that addresses environmental uncertainties and improves out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized training with decentralized execution approaches in cooperative MARL rely on the IGM principle, but their reliability in real-world settings is compromised by environmental uncertainties including sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise.

Method: Proposes DrIGM principle requiring each agent's robust greedy action to align with robust team-optimal joint action. Derives DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that train on robust Q-targets while preserving scalability and integration with existing codebases.

Result: Empirical evaluation on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and StarCraft game environment shows consistent improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DrIGM provides a principled framework for robust cooperative MARL that addresses environmental uncertainties while maintaining compatibility with decentralized execution and existing value-factorization architectures, offering provable robustness guarantees for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AT-RL is a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual anchor tokens, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead by focusing on precise cross-modal credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models, the mechanisms of visual evidence integration during reasoning remain poorly understood, particularly how attention connectivity between visual and textual modalities affects reasoning quality.

Method: The authors analyze multimodal RLVR through cross-modal attention connectivity, identifying that only ~15% of tokens exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. They propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), which selectively reinforces these high-connectivity anchor tokens using graph-based clustering of attention topology, introducing minimal computational overhead.

Result: AT-RL with only 1.2% overhead enables a 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains across STEM, video, and general tasks. Training on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL depends on precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality in multimodal RLVR is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring. Selective reinforcement of high-connectivity anchor tokens provides an efficient mechanism for improving multimodal reasoning with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first comprehensive benchmark for measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems across internal channels (inter-agent messages, shared memory, tool arguments), revealing that output-only audits miss 41.7% of privacy violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLMs only measure output leakage, but multi-agent systems create additional privacy risks through internal channels like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments that remain unmonitored.

Method: Developed AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, featuring a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Tested GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces, analyzing leakage across different channels (C1: output, C2: inter-agent messages, C5: other internal channels).

Result: Multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but increase total system exposure to 68.9% due to unmonitored internal channels. Inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8% vs 27.2% on output channel (C1), meaning output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed lowest leakage (3.3% external, 28.1% internal). Pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently across all models and domains.

Conclusion: Inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems, requiring coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and privacy controls on inter-agent communication. Model-level safety training may help protect internal channels.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Conclusion: Treating internal reasoning processes as primary learning objects enables AI systems to continuously refine their cognitive structures and learning mechanisms, achieving more efficient and adaptive performance in dynamic environments through learning alongside processing.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need to solve multi-step tasks using external tools under strict monetary budgets, but direct planning is intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high outcome variance, and prohibitive exploration costs in this sequential decision-making context with priced and stochastic tool executions.

Method: INTENT (inference-time planning framework) leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated costs, and guide decisions online. It addresses the challenges of planning in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions.

Result: Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines. The framework remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT provides an effective solution for budget-constrained tool-augmented agents by combining intention-aware hierarchical modeling with inference-time planning, enabling practical deployment of LLM agents in real-world scenarios with monetary constraints.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative modeling for semantic-statistical population synthesis, achieving better distribution alignment while maintaining sample feasibility through persona conditioning and marginal regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints but lack semantic conditioning to capture abstract behavioral patterns implicit in survey data, creating a gap in semantic-aware population generation.

Method: SemaPop framework derives high-level persona representations from survey records using LLMs, uses them as semantic conditioning signals, incorporates marginal regularization for alignment with target marginals, and implements with WGAN-GP backbone (SemaPop-GAN).

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning; ablation studies confirm contributions of semantic persona conditioning and architectural choices.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical fusion and provides a modular foundation for generative population projection systems integrating individual behavioral semantics with population statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

*Aditya Taparia,Som Sagar,Ransalu Senanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARC learns hierarchical RL policies to dynamically configure LLM agents per query, outperforming fixed templates with 25% higher accuracy and reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics for configuration, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute since the same configuration is applied to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts).

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating that dynamic configuration can significantly improve both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

*Jingdi Chen,Hanqing Yang,Zongjun Liu,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of multi-agent communication evolution through MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM-based approaches, analyzed via the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, why).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication is essential for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic, partially observable environments, but existing approaches have limitations in interpretability, generalization, and scalability that need systematic analysis.

Method: Survey methodology using the Five Ws framework (who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, why communication is beneficial) to analyze three paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Emergent Language (EL), and LLM-based systems.

Result: Traces evolution from MARL's hand-designed/implicit protocols to end-to-end learned communication, then to EL's structured/symbolic communication, and finally to LLM-based natural language priors; identifies trade-offs, design patterns, and unsolved challenges across paradigms.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable, interpretable multi-agent collaboration, addressing grounding, generalization, and scalability challenges across MARL, EL, and LLM approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces modality-aware RL post-training with benchmark annotation, policy optimization, and adaptive curriculum to address modality-blind training issues in multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE comprises: (1) MAPLE-bench benchmark annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. Systematic analysis establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy.

Conclusion: MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training, addressing modality-blind training limitations through modality-aware optimization, adaptive weighting, and curriculum scheduling.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

*Yiming Gao,Zhen Wang,Jefferson Chen,Mark Antkowiak,Mengzhou Hu,JungHo Kong,Dexter Pratt,Jieyuan Liu,Enze Ma,Zhiting Hu,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework enabling LLMs to perform omics-native reasoning by directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and using bioinformatics tools, converting core analyses into step-by-step reasoning problems that models must solve, justify, and revise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language models to perform interpretable, auditable single-cell analyses by grounding them directly in raw omics data rather than relying on pre-processed or summarized information, addressing the need for transparent reasoning in computational biology.

Method: scPilot converts core single-cell analyses (cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, transcription-factor targeting) into step-by-step reasoning problems. LLMs converse in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and using on-demand bioinformatics tools, with iterative reasoning processes that allow for justification and revision with new evidence.

Result: Experiments show iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (with o1 model) and reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% (with Gemini-2.5-Pro) compared to one-shot prompting. The framework generates transparent reasoning traces that explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic.

Conclusion: By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses, representing a significant advancement toward transparent computational biology through omics-native reasoning.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

### [57] [When Agents Disagree With Themselves: Measuring Behavioral Consistency in LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11619)
*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents exhibit significant behavioral inconsistency across identical task runs, with variance predicting failure rates - consistent behavior correlates with high accuracy while inconsistent behavior leads to poor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when running the same task multiple times, and to understand how behavioral variance relates to task success/failure rates.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, analyzing action sequence variance and its correlation with accuracy.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average; tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks (≥6 unique paths) achieve only 25-60% accuracy. 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: Behavioral inconsistency in LLM agents predicts failure, with most variance emerging early in execution. Monitoring consistency during runtime could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

TL;DR: NMIPS is a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver that discovers analytical solutions for PDE families using multifactorial optimization and affine transfer, achieving 35.7% accuracy improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods require independent solving of each PDE instance in a family, incurring massive computational costs. Machine learning PDE solvers offer speed but lack interpretability as they provide numerical approximations rather than analytical expressions needed for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Employs affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by providing computationally efficient, interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic solving.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show poor performance on mathematical spatial reasoning tasks (below 60% accuracy) despite humans achieving over 95% accuracy, revealing a fundamental weakness in models' ability to parse and manipulate 2D/3D relations.

Method: MathSpatial framework includes: (1) MathSpatial-Bench - 2K benchmark problems across 3 categories and 11 subtypes designed to isolate reasoning from perceptual noise; (2) MathSpatial-Corpus - 8K training dataset with verified solutions; (3) MathSpatial-SRT - structured reasoning traces using three atomic operations (Correlate, Constrain, Infer).

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25%, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing a critical gap in current model capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm addressing RL limitations for medical QA, using a multi-dimensional alignment matrix and unified optimization with scale normalization and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL alignment methods (RLHF and RL from verifiable rewards) are inadequate for medical QA due to expensive preference annotations, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and inability to handle complex clinical contexts. Medical alignment requires simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, but multi-objective heterogeneous rewards suffer from scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.

Method: 1) Constructs a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix decomposing objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. 2) Establishes closed loops where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which drives optimizable rewards for fine-grained supervision. 3) Proposes unified optimization with Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed robust medical alignment paradigm addresses fundamental limitations of existing RL methods for medical QA, providing a comprehensive framework for simultaneous optimization of multiple alignment objectives through structured decomposition and unified optimization mechanisms.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic agentic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to address the semantic-physical disconnect in LLM-based autonomous CFD agents, achieving 96% relative improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD are limited by their probabilistic nature, which struggles to enforce strict conservation laws and numerical stability. Pure semantic RAG leads to "context poisoning" where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect.

Method: PhyNiKCE introduces a neurosymbolic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions.

Result: Validated through OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while lowering LLM token consumption by 17%.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in autonomous CFD agents. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a data-driven framework for auditing LLM evaluation benchmarks across three axes: capability discrimination, anti-saturation, and impact, to address benchmark unreliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM benchmarks are becoming increasingly unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, eroding their authority and leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy.

Method: Developed the Benchmark Health Index (BHI) framework with three orthogonal axes: (1) Capability Discrimination (separation of model performance beyond noise), (2) Anti-Saturation (remaining headroom before ceiling effects), and (3) Impact (influence across academic/industrial ecosystems). Applied to 106 validated benchmarks from 91 representative models in 2025.

Result: Systematically characterized the evaluation landscape using BHI, providing the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level and enabling principled benchmark selection.

Conclusion: BHI offers a principled basis for benchmark selection and enables dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols, addressing the reliability crisis in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [63] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Rung Collapse as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models learn associations instead of interventions, leading to Aleatoric Entrenchment where correct outcomes reinforce flawed reasoning. It proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) as a belief revision objective that penalizes causal reasoning errors independently of task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift. This pathology stems from autoregressive training's inability to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), leading to models that are "right for the wrong reasons" and become entrenched in flawed causal reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. It introduces a three-layer architecture with: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem proving actuator independence implements valid do-operations; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates; (3) a failure mode taxonomy with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs show Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), with steerability exhibiting inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction. Targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails, with proven asymptotic recovery of true interventional distribution and finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that current autoregressive training fundamentally fails to distinguish association from intervention, leading to Rung Collapse and Aleatoric Entrenchment. ERM provides a principled solution through causal belief revision that prevents entrenchment even when models succeed for wrong reasons, enabling recovery of true causal reasoning.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs to address structural blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving significant accuracy improvements on electrical compliance checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning about structural dependencies.

Method: Proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level, demonstrating significant improvement over pixel-based methods.

Conclusion: Structure-aware representations (like V2G) provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains, highlighting the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods for structural reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit token-based reasoning and latent reasoning based on model confidence, improving accuracy while reducing generation length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning efficiency varies across settings, and analysis shows that incorrect reasoning trajectories contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones. Soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter is an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism that routes thinking to discrete token space when model confidence is low (for explicit reasoning), and to latent space when confidence is high (for efficient latent reasoning).

Result: Outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines with average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter effectively balances explicit and latent reasoning through confidence-aware routing, achieving better accuracy and efficiency by avoiding high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories and reducing noise propagation.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses sparse complementary fusion with reverse KL divergence to reduce functional interference and improve merging stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: SCF-RKL uses reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure functional divergence between models and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates, avoiding assumptions of linear additivity in parameter space.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods across 24 benchmarks covering advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety, while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL provides an effective model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse complementary fusion, enabling better integration of specialized models without costly retraining.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

*Thomas Jiralerspong,Trenton Bricken*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cross-architecture model diffing using Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) enables unsupervised identification of safety-critical behaviors in novel LLM architectures, including political alignment, cultural biases, and content refusal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model diffing methods are limited to comparing base models with their finetunes, but new LLM releases often feature novel architectures. Cross-architecture methods are essential for making model diffing widely applicable to identify safety-critical behaviors across different model families.

Method: Introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification to Crosscoders that better isolates features unique to one model. Applies this technique for cross-architecture model diffing to compare different LLM architectures in an unsupervised fashion.

Result: Successfully identified specific safety-critical behaviors: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing with DFCs is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, establishing it as a valuable tool for safety analysis across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable preflight planning method for large UAV fleets that uses prioritized planning with iterative conflict resolution, achieving near-100% success for up to 1,000 UAVs with 50% runtime reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world UTM with temporal NFZs, heterogeneous UAVs, and strict delivery deadlines in dynamic shared airspace.

Method: Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution: 1) Initial solution by mission urgency prioritization, 2) SFIPP-ST 4D single-agent planner for roundtrip trajectories with soft conflict constraints, 3) Iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by geometric conflict graph, 4) Completeness-preserving directional pruning for 3D search acceleration.

Result: Achieves near-100% success with fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search, scales successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR provides a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace, addressing real-world UTM challenges with temporal NFZs and heterogeneous UAV fleets.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems, featuring 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains with multi-GQL support and a novel evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-GQL datasets are limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, and evaluation scope, hindering systematic advancement of these systems. There's a lack of high-quality benchmarks to compare model capabilities across different GQLs and domains.

Method: Created Text2GQL-Bench with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets across different domains, question abstraction levels, and graph query languages using heterogeneous resources. The benchmark includes 178,184 question-query pairs spanning 13 domains.

Result: Evaluation reveals a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: strong LLMs achieve only ≤4% execution accuracy zero-shot, but 3-shot prompting raises accuracy to ~50% (though grammatical validity remains <70%). A fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity.

Conclusion: Most performance improvement in ISO-GQL generation comes from exposure to sufficient examples. Text2GQL-Bench provides a unified benchmark with comprehensive evaluation metrics (grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, execution accuracy) to advance Text-to-GQL systems.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

### [70] [AIR: Improving Agent Safety through Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11749)
*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is the first incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously detects, contains, recovers from, and prevents future incidents through semantic checks, guided remediation, and synthesized guardrail rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus on preventing failures in advance but lack capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably occur, creating a critical gap in agent safety.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for managing incident response lifecycle integrated into agent execution loops, enabling: (1) incident detection via semantic checks grounded in environment state and context, (2) guided containment and recovery actions via agent tools, and (3) synthesis of guardrail rules during eradication to prevent similar future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach effectiveness of developer-authored rules, with experiments confirming design necessity, timeliness, and moderate overhead.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, with AIR demonstrating that autonomous incident management can effectively complement preventive safety measures.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) is a training-time approach that uses lightweight tree-style search during rollout generation to improve multi-turn reinforcement learning for language model agents, achieving up to 15% performance gains with stable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn reinforcement learning for language model agents faces challenges with sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments. Naive trajectory sampling can lead to poor exploitation and mode collapse, limiting agent performance.

Method: TSR repurposes test-time search techniques for training-time rollout generation. It performs lightweight tree-style search (best-of-N, beam search, shallow lookahead) to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback, while keeping the underlying optimization objective unchanged.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks with a one-time increase in training compute. It works with both PPO and GRPO optimizers, demonstrating optimizer-agnostic benefits.

Conclusion: By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning that complements existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven binarization framework for species distribution models that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing evaluation metrics, outperforming traditional thresholding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional binarization of probabilistic SDM predictions is heuristic and distorts species prevalence estimates and community composition, creating a need for more robust methods.

Method: MaxExp framework selects species assemblages by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics without calibration data; SSE method predicts assemblages based on expected species richness as a computationally efficient alternative.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization, offering improved performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment, using multi-dimensional rewards for conversion metrics and compliance constraints to improve advertising effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial advertising systems use a two-stage paradigm (text generation followed by metric alignment) that causes misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.

Method: RELATE integrates generation and alignment within a single model using reinforcement learning. It incorporates conversion-oriented metrics and compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling policy learning to generate high-quality ad texts that optimize for ultimate advertiser value.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets show RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) under strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: RELATE successfully addresses the limitations of decoupled advertising systems by providing an end-to-end framework that unifies text generation with performance and compliance objectives, demonstrating robust real-world effectiveness in improving advertising conversion performance.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging.

Method: Execute-Summarize (ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness.

Result: Introduced FlowBench and showed through extensive experiments that the ES approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Conclusion: The ES framework offers an effective solution for translating LLM task solutions into accurate structured workflows by separating execution from workflow construction, addressing interference issues in prior integrated approaches.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems through structured executable scripts rather than direct pixel synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, suffering from low procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Decomposes generation into specialized agents (Solution, Illustration, Narration) coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent with quality gates, iterative critique mechanisms, semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks to produce structured executable video scripts.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding one million videos per day with over 95% cost reduction compared to industry standards while maintaining high acceptance rates through deterministic compilation of synchronized visuals and narration.

Conclusion: LAVES demonstrates that structured, multi-agent approaches with explicit quality control mechanisms can effectively address the limitations of direct pixel synthesis for logically rigorous educational video generation at scale.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-$k$NN Distance is a black-box detection method that identifies RLVR-trained prompts by measuring reduced diversity in model generations, outperforming existing contamination detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training raises concerns about benchmark contamination since it fine-tunes models based on reward feedback rather than token probabilities, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods ineffective. There's a need for methods to detect whether prompts have been seen during RLVR training.

Method: Min-$k$NN Distance: a black-box detector that samples multiple completions for a given prompt and computes the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. It quantifies the behavioral signature where RLVR training causes prompts to produce more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity.

Result: Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Conclusion: Min-$k$NN Distance provides an effective black-box method for detecting RLVR contamination by exploiting the distinctive behavioral signature of reduced generation diversity in RL-trained prompts, requiring no access to reference models or token probabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM: Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal recommendation framework with disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical transformer architecture for improved recommendation performance, especially in cold-start scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal recommendation approaches face two key challenges: (1) suboptimal tokenization where methods like RQ-VAE lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchical structure of user interactions, items, and tokens.

Method: Proposes Hi-SAM with two core designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via coarse-to-fine strategy with shared codebooks for consensus and modality-specific codebooks for nuances, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy, and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory while retaining details for current items.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing multi-modal recommendation approaches by introducing disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical transformer architecture, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both offline experiments and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves weather forecasting by addressing limited diffusability in LDMs through 3D-MAE for weather-state conditioning and variable-aware spectral regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models struggle with limited diffusability in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to lack of meteorological foundation models and inappropriate spectral regularization that treats all variables identically despite their spectral heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) to encode weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning, and 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) that adaptively selects spectral thresholds based on each variable's energy distribution.

Result: PuYun-LDM achieves superior performance to ENS (presumably ECMWF ensemble) at short lead times while remaining comparable at longer horizons. It generates 15-day global forecasts with 6-hour resolution in 5 minutes on a single H200 GPU, with parallel ensemble production capability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances latent diffusability for weather forecasting by addressing meteorological-specific challenges through weather-state conditioning and variable-aware spectral regularization, enabling efficient high-resolution ensemble forecasting.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for efficient LLM inference that reuses internal hidden states for accurate sequence length prediction, reducing computational waste from padding in batched inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and RL sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods relying on auxiliary models for static length prediction incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: Introduces a lightweight framework with two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) - uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) - dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. The framework reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction.

Result: Built and released ForeLen benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16% over the best baseline. Integrating methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: The work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by addressing the computational waste from padding through lightweight, accurate length prediction that reuses existing model computations.

*Jialin Wu,Wei Shi,Han Shen,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Zhicong Huang,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS is a training-free framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention at specific network depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination because visual features and pretrained textual representations become intertwined in deeper network layers, suppressing visual information.

Method: REVIS uses latent space geometry to extract pure visual information vectors via orthogonal projection, then performs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where visual suppression occurs, without requiring training.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving general reasoning capabilities, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The training-free REVIS framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by surgically reactivating suppressed visual information through geometric operations and targeted interventions.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a novel autoregressive language model architecture using prototype vectors instead of self-attention, offering linear sequence scaling, interpretable concept learning, and targeted model editing while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art language models lack interpretability in their reasoning processes, which undermines trust and introduces risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for models that are both high-performing and interpretable by design.

Method: ProtoT replaces standard self-attention with prototype-based architecture using parameter vectors (prototypes) that engage in two-way communication with input sequences. These prototypes automatically learn nameable concepts during training and create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales.

Result: ProtoT achieves linear computational scaling with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs competitively on text generation and GLUE tasks, scales well with model/data size, shows robustness to input perturbations, and provides interpretable pathways showing how robustness/sensitivity arises.

Conclusion: ProtoT demonstrates that well-performing autoregressive language models can be designed to be interpretable by design, offering both competitive performance and transparency through prototype-based architecture that captures meaningful concepts and enables targeted behavior editing.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRCsim simulation framework generates VRC cooperative perception data, enabling creation of VRC-QA dataset for spatial reasoning. Talk2DM module adds natural language querying to dynamic maps via chain-of-prompt mechanism, achieving high accuracy with practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic maps lack natural-language human interfaces despite being fundamental infrastructure for VRC cooperative autonomous driving. This gap limits human-DM interaction and prevents leveraging LLM capabilities for spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes.

Method: 1) Develop VRCsim simulation framework to generate streaming VRC cooperative perception data. 2) Construct VRC-QA dataset focused on spatial querying and reasoning. 3) Propose Talk2DM plug-and-play module with chain-of-prompt mechanism that integrates human-defined rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy on VRC-QA dataset with average response time of 2-5 seconds. The system demonstrates strong generalization across different LLMs (Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, GPT-oss), though larger models show accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully extends VRC dynamic map systems with natural language querying capabilities, demonstrating practical potential for enhancing human-DM interaction in cooperative autonomous driving through effective integration of simulation, dataset creation, and LLM-based reasoning.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics and cannot dynamically adapt to environmental changes or robustly handle unexpected failures, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through meaningful collaboration.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation as a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, incorporating transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications, clarity of intent, and trust establishment mechanisms.

Result: The framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive delegation framework addresses limitations of current methods by incorporating comprehensive governance elements (authority, responsibility, accountability) and trust mechanisms, enabling more robust and flexible collaboration between AI agents and humans in complex task environments.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

*Yifan Luo,Yang Zhan,Jiedong Jiang,Tianyang Liu,Mingrui Wu,Zhennan Zhou,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSAE (Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder) learns hierarchical feature structures in LLMs by jointly training multiple SAEs with parent-child relationships, using structural constraints and feature perturbation to improve hierarchy recovery while maintaining reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders extract monosemantic features from LLMs in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical language structure. The phenomenon of "feature splitting" indicates features are organized hierarchically, necessitating methods to discover these multi-scale conceptual structures.

Method: HSAE jointly learns a series of sparse autoencoders and parent-child relationships between their features. It introduces two novel mechanisms: (1) a structural constraint loss to strengthen parent-child alignment, and (2) a random feature perturbation mechanism to improve hierarchy learning.

Result: Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers show HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, validated by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. HSAE maintains reconstruction fidelity and interpretability comparable to standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations, advancing beyond isolated feature extraction to capture the hierarchical organization of language knowledge in neural networks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

### [85] [When Should LLMs Be Less Specific? Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11908)
*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by replacing uncertain content with higher-confidence abstractions instead of binary abstention, improving factual accuracy while preserving information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from factual errors that undermine trust and limit high-risk adoption. Binary abstention approaches are too restrictive in long-form settings, discarding valuable information when models are uncertain.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Proposes Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims and replaces uncertain atoms with higher-confidence, less specific abstractions. Develops end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation measuring risk as factual correctness and coverage using information-theoretic measures.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms baselines, improving area under risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating better accuracy and reliability while preserving original meaning.

Conclusion: Selective Abstraction provides a more nuanced alternative to binary abstention, enabling LLMs to maintain reliability while preserving information by trading specificity for confidence, offering practical benefits for factual accuracy in open-ended generation.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE introduces a DAG-based framework for alpha factor mining that treats factor pools as interconnected ecosystems, outperforming existing methods through principled retrieval and DAG-aware generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha mining methods (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) lack global structural view, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity.

Method: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with two core components: Bayesian Factor Retriever (balances exploitation/exploration via posterior probability) and DAG-aware Factor Generator (uses full ancestral trace for context-aware optimizations).

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 baselines show AlphaPROBE significantly improves predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery, and the DAG-based approach provides superior factor mining capabilities.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

TL;DR: MEME is a novel framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of investment narratives, using multi-agent extraction and Gaussian mixture modeling to identify and track profitable market logics for portfolio construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based financial methods focus on either asset-centric stock prediction or market-centric portfolio allocation without capturing the underlying reasoning driving market movements. There's a need to model financial markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment narratives to better understand and exploit market dynamics.

Method: MEME employs: 1) Multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments; 2) Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within semantic space; 3) Temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track lifecycle and historical profitability of market modes; 4) Focus on enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies for robust portfolio construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools (2023-2025) show MEME consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case studies, and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to evolving market consensus.

Conclusion: MEME successfully operationalizes a logic-oriented perspective on financial markets, modeling them as evolutionary ecosystems of competing investment narratives. The framework demonstrates superior performance by prioritizing robust reasoning and adapting to evolving market consensus, offering a more sophisticated approach to quantitative finance with LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/gta0804/MEME.

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic asynchronous environments with temporal constraints, dynamic events, and collaboration requirements, featuring action-level evaluation and verifiable rewards for RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior static/synchronous evaluations by creating a benchmark that tests LLM agents in realistic asynchronous environments where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring adaptation to temporal constraints, noisy/dynamic events, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration.

Method: Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments (ARE) platform, Gaia2 introduces scenarios with write-action verifiers for fine-grained action-level evaluation. Each scenario pairs with verifiers enabling direct use for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards.

Result: Evaluation shows no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) achieves strongest overall score (42% pass@1) but fails on time-sensitive tasks; Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy/speed for cost; Kimi-K2 leads open-source models (21% pass@1). Results reveal trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness and expose sim2real gap challenges.

Conclusion: Gaia2 provides a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the ARE framework, the authors aim to advance next-generation agent systems with realistic asynchronous evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation focus on realism and diversity but fail to assess whether generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology, which is crucial for safe healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval) framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated images and their conditioning prompts, identifying semantic inconsistencies.

Result: CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and demonstrates correlation with expert judgment, providing clinically meaningful evaluation.

Conclusion: CSEval offers a scalable, clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from LLM reasoning to enhance performance on reasoning tasks without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhance LLM reasoning through prompt adjustment are intuitive but lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral patterns perspective.

Method: Two optimization methods: 1) InjectCorrect - guides models by imitating behavioral patterns from their own past correct answers; 2) InjectRLOpt - learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses a Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference.

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter updates, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types, and structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence reasoning quality. The proposed parameter-free methods effectively leverage behavioral patterns to enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

*Xinyu Yang,Chenlong Deng,Tongyu Wen,Binyu Xie,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LawThinker is an autonomous legal research agent that uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with atomic verification after each knowledge exploration step to ensure procedurally compliant legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain, which is problematic since legal reasoning requires both correct outcomes and procedurally compliant processes.

Method: LawThinker adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance. It enforces verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step and includes a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the verification gap in legal reasoning by enforcing atomic verification after each exploration step, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both dynamic and static legal reasoning benchmarks while ensuring procedural compliance.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics.

### [92] [Differentiable Modal Logic for Multi-Agent Diagnosis, Orchestration and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12083)
*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data in multi-agent systems through Modal Logical Neural Networks, providing interpretable neurosymbolic debugging for epistemic, temporal, deontic, and doxastic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent AI systems are evolving from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, requiring debugging of semantic failures involving knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation. Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems, creating a need for automated learning of these structures from behavioral data.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) that learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data. The framework uses four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (causality), deontic (permissions), and doxastic (confidence interpretation). Logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives.

Result: The approach provides interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters rather than opaque embeddings. It enables knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data, compositional multi-modal reasoning combining epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints, and practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control, and communication of multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML offers a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework for multi-agent systems that can learn complex modal relationships from behavioral data, providing interpretable structures for trust, causality, and regulatory boundaries while enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios with complete implementations provided as executable Jupyter notebooks.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

*Xiaoyuan Liu,Tian Liang,Dongyang Ma,Deyu Zhou,Haitao Mi,Pinjia He,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StateLM introduces foundation models with internal reasoning loops and memory tools to actively manage context, enabling stateful reasoning that significantly outperforms standard LLMs on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack agency to actively manage their context/memory, remaining passive recipients of manually engineered context within fixed window constraints, analogous to Dumbledore having a Pensieve but no wand to use it.

Method: Introduces StateLM with internal reasoning loop and memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking), training models to actively manage these tools and dynamically engineer their own context.

Result: StateLMs outperform standard LLMs across all scales on long-document QA, achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks, and reach 52% accuracy vs 5% for standard LLMs on BrowseComp-Plus deep research tasks.

Conclusion: StateLM transforms LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents, making reasoning a stateful and manageable process that breaks free from fixed context window limitations.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reflections and coordinating length penalties based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate over-long chains-of-thought with excessive reflections (repetitive self-questioning, circular reasoning) that increase token consumption, computational overhead, and latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models. Problem complexity exacerbates this issue, reducing accuracy while increasing token overhead.

Method: ARLCP (Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty) uses reinforcement learning with two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. These coordinated penalties encourage more concise and effective reasoning paths.

Result: On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models: For 1.5B model, reduces average response length by 53.1% while improving accuracy by 5.8%. For 7B model, achieves 35.0% reduction in length with 2.7% accuracy gain. Superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ARLCP effectively addresses the over-reflection problem in Large Reasoning Models by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy through adaptive penalties, achieving significant reductions in response length while simultaneously improving accuracy across different model sizes.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-shot time series foundation models (TSFMs) with leakage-safe covariates and an Institutional Operating Conditions Index perform comparably to classical benchmarks for university enrolment forecasting without institution-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and need accurate enrolment forecasts, but traditional methods struggle with short annual data series, reporting changes, and structural breaks in higher education contexts.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting with compact, leakage-safe covariates; introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) derived from documentary evidence; use Google Trends demand proxies with stabilizing feature engineering; employ expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model type.

Conclusion: Zero-shot TSFMs with carefully constructed leakage-safe covariates and regime indicators like IOCI provide viable alternatives to classical methods for data-sparse institutional enrolment forecasting.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

### [96] [HLA: Hadamard Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12128)
*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) is a new linear attention variant that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (like standard attention) rather than separately to queries/keys, resulting in a higher-degree rational function approximation to softmax with efficient computation and no tensor reshaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers has high computational cost, especially for applications with large token counts like video generation. Existing linear attention methods apply kernel functions independently to inputs before similarity calculation, resulting in low-degree rational approximations to softmax that may limit expressiveness.

Method: Proposes Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) where nonlinearity is applied after computing pairwise similarities (analogous to standard softmax attention) rather than separately to queries and keys. Derives an efficient computational scheme similar to standard linear attention that avoids time-consuming tensor reshaping operations.

Result: HLA provides a higher-degree rational function approximation to softmax compared to previous linear attention methods. The approach demonstrates effectiveness when applied to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application involving very large token counts.

Conclusion: HLA offers a novel linear attention formulation that maintains the post-similarity nonlinearity structure of standard attention while achieving computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for applications with massive token sequences like video generation.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone biases in widely deployed models.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts across two models. Employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales.

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models exhibited strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). Models diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing systematic biases. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework measuring how alignment interventions (prompting, fine-tuning, etc.) propagate across interconnected values, revealing systemic risks invisible to conventional target-only evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment research typically treats values statically, ignoring how interventions reshape the broader value system. There's a need to understand the dynamic propagation of alignment-induced changes across interconnected values.

Method: Introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT) framework to measure alignment-induced changes relative to on-target gain. Uses controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, collecting paired pre-post normative judgments to analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These systemic effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing process-level alignment risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: The VAT framework offers new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs, highlighting systemic risks and structured value co-movement that conventional evaluation methods miss.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive large model evaluation is prohibitively expensive, and existing methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR combines specialized retrievers for external knowledge with Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty, then refines predictions using Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity with only 1-2 observed scores per test model.

Conclusion: The STAR framework effectively bridges data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning to address challenges in model performance prediction from limited observations, providing traceable explanations alongside improved accuracy.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

TL;DR: A novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with T5 architecture that compresses data into token sequences rather than vector representations, achieving higher compression ratios while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data formats, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for methods that preserve token-based structure while achieving better compression ratios.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning applied to T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences. Employs off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimizing redundancy. The system works independently of external grammatical or world knowledge, leveraging latent information within language models.

Result: Significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. The approach effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, maintaining semantic integrity while achieving higher compression efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based token sequence compression method offers a robust and practical solution that preserves data structure, achieves better compression ratios than traditional methods, and paves the way for improved compression across various applications.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

TL;DR: LLMs show social task proficiency but lack a coherent, domain-general Theory of Mind (ToM) as evidenced by failures on logically equivalent tasks and inconsistencies between action predictions and mental state inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) - a causal model of mental states and behavior - rather than just surface-level social task proficiency. Current benchmarks don't test for the actual representations posited by ToM theory.

Method: Developed a cognitively-grounded evaluation framework that probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior. Tested LLMs on simple ToM paradigms and logically equivalent tasks, examining consistency between action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Result: LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in simple ToM paradigms but fail at logically equivalent tasks. They exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Conclusion: The social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind. LLMs lack the coherent causal model of mental states and behavior that characterizes genuine ToM.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use small annotated dataset to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier; 2) Introduce geometric reward mechanism considering consensus, reliability, and diversity to drive large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE successfully enables LLMs to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning, addressing limitations in scientific reasoning tasks and improving evaluation system robustness and diversity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

### [103] [Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170)
*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN) with negation support and natural language parsing capabilities, creating a complete inference system that integrates LLMs for preprocessing and grammar-based parsing for formal semantic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two key limitations from previous work: lack of negation/backward reasoning capabilities in QBBNs and absence of natural language parsing. The goal is to create a complete system that bridges formal semantics with modern LLM capabilities while maintaining rigorous logical inference.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors enforcing probability constraints (P(x) + P(neg x) = 1), enabling contrapositive reasoning via backward lambda messages. Introduces a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates and modal quantifiers. Develops a typed slot grammar for deterministic sentence-to-logical-form compilation. Uses LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation, grammar for parsing, LLMs for reranking, and QBBN for inference.

Result: The system achieves 44/44 test cases across 22 reasoning patterns for inference. Grammar parsing achieves 33/33 correct logical forms with zero ambiguity. LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy for disambiguation but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming grammar necessity.

Conclusion: The architecture successfully reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" by using LLMs to eliminate annotation bottlenecks while maintaining rigorous logical verification through QBBNs. This hybrid approach leverages LLMs as annotators/preprocessors while preserving formal grammar and inference systems for reliable semantic analysis.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

TL;DR: A pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that uses educational principles to systematically identify knowledge deficiencies, organize progressive curricula, and adapt representations to student models' cognitive capacity, achieving significant performance improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM knowledge distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process, failing to leverage educational principles for more effective knowledge transfer to smaller student models.

Method: Proposes a three-stage pipeline called Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) that: 1) identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, 2) organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and 3) adapts representations to match student cognitive capacity. Integrates Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process with controlled difficulty increments.

Result: IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of parameters. Particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The pedagogically-inspired framework demonstrates that applying educational principles to LLM knowledge distillation creates a more systematic and effective learning process, enabling smaller student models to achieve near-teacher performance with significantly fewer parameters, especially benefiting complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder size by 88% while maintaining segmentation performance by replacing SAM3's large text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation, addressing redundancy in vision-language segmentation prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large general-purpose text encoders designed for open-ended language understanding, but segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead due to over-provisioning.

Method: Conducted large-scale analysis of 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks, revealing severe redundancy in text prompting. Proposed SAM3-LiteText framework that replaces original SAM3 text encoder with compact MobileCLIP student optimized by knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to original SAM3 model on image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that lightweight text encoding is feasible for vision-language segmentation by addressing the redundancy in segmentation prompts, enabling efficient models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes street name transcriptions with 44% error rate, disproportionately affecting non-English speakers; synthetic data generation improves accuracy by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite low word error rates on standard benchmarks, speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments, particularly for street name transcription where errors have significant downstream consequences.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from major providers on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers' street name recordings; introduced synthetic data generation approach using open-source text-to-speech models to produce diverse pronunciations; fine-tuned with <1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% across models; routing distance errors twice as large for non-English primary speakers; fine-tuning with synthetic data improved street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Conclusion: Highlights critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems; demonstrates scalable synthetic data approach to reduce high-stakes transcription errors, particularly benefiting linguistically diverse populations.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based framework that mimics scientific reasoning by first inferring physical properties like symmetries, then using these as priors to guide symbolic regression engines for equation discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems for symbolic equation discovery directly guess equations from data without modeling the multi-step reasoning process scientists use, which involves first inferring physical properties like symmetries and using them as priors.

Method: KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure (physical properties), then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines (PySINDy, PySR) including their function libraries and structural constraints.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly following the scientific reasoning process of first inferring physical properties and using them as priors leads to more accurate and robust symbolic equation discovery compared to direct equation guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework for multi-turn AI agents that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards, using fine-grained binary criteria and LLM-simulated environments to optimize tool-using agents without verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying reinforcement learning to real-world AI agents is difficult because realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, RL for multi-turn tool use is underexplored, and building executable tool environments is costly and limits scale.

Method: CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, using sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training occurs in scalable LLM-simulated tool environments to avoid heavy engineering for large tool sets.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model trained on 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox. Results match or outperform similarly sized open-source baselines including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, demonstrating consistent improvements over supervised fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage compared to uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior on multi-step agentic tasks is poorly understood. Uniform per-step compute allocation shows diminishing returns in long-horizon environments, and small errors can compound over time.

Method: First conducted empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. Found that uncertainty statistics (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) from agent's vote distribution correlate with downstream success. Developed CATTS which uses these vote-derived uncertainty signals to dynamically allocate compute only when decisions are contentious.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. Provides both efficiency gains and interpretable decision rules.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware test-time scaling using vote-derived uncertainty is an effective approach for multi-step agents, offering performance improvements with computational efficiency and interpretability compared to uniform scaling methods.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
