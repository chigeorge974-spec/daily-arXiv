This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset."}

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap.

However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms."}

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation.

While promising to compress research timelines from years to weeks, their deployment introduces unprecedented safety challenges differing from traditional laboratories or purely digital AI. This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles. Evaluation against the LabSafety Bench reveals that current foundation models exhibit significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential rather than optional. Our framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for safe deployment of autonomous scientific systems, establishing the groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven discovery."}

However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning."}

Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search following the PRISMA guideline, identifying 86 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs are transforming the fundamentals of HRI by reshaping how robots sense context, generate socially grounded interactions, and maintain continuous alignment with human needs in embodied settings; and (2) current research is largely exploratory, with different studies focusing on different facets of LLM-driven HRI, resulting in wide-ranging choices of experimental setups, study methods, and evaluation metrics.

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks."}

Here, we address the critical problem of maintaining balance in the human-SLs system, a prerequisite for safe and comfortable augmentation tasks. Unlike previous approaches that developed SLs specifically for stability support, we propose a general framework for preserving balance with SLs designed for generic use. Our hierarchical three-layer architecture consists of: (i) a prediction layer that estimates human trunk and center of mass (CoM) dynamics, (ii) a planning layer that generates optimal CoM trajectories to counteract trunk movements and computes the corresponding SL control inputs, and (iii) a control layer that executes these inputs on the SL hardware. We evaluated the framework with ten participants performing forward and lateral bending tasks. The results show a clear reduction in stance instability, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing balance. This work paves the path towards safe and versatile human-SLs interactions.

Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications."}

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM."}

Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.\n  We propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment. Experiments on a newly introduced Handles dataset and a DexGraspNet subset demonstrate that our approach achieves over 120 distinct stable grasps per object (a 1.7-6x improvement over unrefined analytical methods) while outperforming diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60\\% in unique grasp coverage."}

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."}

By encoding the segmentations of detected road users into colour coded highlights within low resolution greyscale imagery, the required data rate can be reduced by 50 \\% compared with conventional techniques, while maintaining visual clarity. This enables a median glass-to-glass latency of below 200ms even when the network data rate is below 500kbit/s, while clearly outlining salient road users to enhance situational awareness of the remote operator.

However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy."}

Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions. When used as a repair layer on base detectors, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage. These results demonstrate X-MAP's effectiveness and interpretability for improving spam and phishing detection."}

However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback."}

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning."}

To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web."}

Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment."}

Consequently, the fundamental question of \\textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \\textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks.

Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions.

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations."}

However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments."}

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior.

These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters."}

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory.

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control."}

Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines."}

We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks.

We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion.

Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks.

To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state."}

To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration.

Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study."}

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry."}

This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control."}

MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems.

In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands).

These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment.

This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles.

Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents."}

In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations."}

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments."}

In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework."}

This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control."}

MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems. LSMART is available at https://smart-mapf.github.io/lifelong-smart."}

However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled \"motion-terrain\" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments."}

Proceedings of the 2026 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '26)", "summary": "Robot-assisted feeding enables people with disabilities who require assistance eating to enjoy a meal independently and with dignity. However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table.
