*Mengyun Liu,Shanshan Huang,Jianan Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EdgeNav-QE optimizes Large Action Models for edge navigation by combining 4-bit quantization with dynamic early-exit, achieving 82.7% latency reduction and 66.7% memory savings while maintaining 81.8% navigation success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Action Models (LAMs) show potential for autonomous navigation but face deployment challenges on edge devices due to memory constraints and latency requirements. Multi-billion parameter models cannot be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained edge hardware.

Method: Proposes EdgeNav-QE framework integrating Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with dynamic early-exit mechanism. Quantizes backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically places early-exit branches, enabling early termination for simple tasks while retaining full depth for complex decision-making.

Result: On Habitat-Sim environment with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone: 82.7% inference latency reduction, 66.7% memory footprint reduction compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency.

Conclusion: EdgeNav-QE demonstrates effective optimization of LAMs for edge deployment through quantization and adaptive computation. The dynamic early-exit mechanism provides content-aware computation allocation, making it superior for safety-critical applications where both efficiency and reliability are crucial.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) have shown immense potential in autonomous navigation by bridging high-level reasoning with low-level control. However, deploying these multi-billion parameter models on edge devices remains a significant challenge due to memory constraints and latency requirements. In this paper, we propose EdgeNav-QE, a novel framework that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with a dynamic early-exit (DEE) mechanism to optimize LAMs for real-time edge navigation. By quantizing the backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically placing early-exit branches, we enable the model to terminate inference early for simple navigation tasks while retaining full depth for complex decision-making. Experimental results on the Habitat-Sim environment with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone, demonstrate that EdgeNav-QE reduces inference latency by 82.7% and memory footprint by 66.7% compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency, demonstrating the superiority of content-aware adaptive computation for safety-critical applications.

*Siyuan Chen,Fuyuan Zhang,Hua Qi,Lei Ma,Tomoyuki Tsuchiya,Michio Hayashi,Manabu Okada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage ADS testing framework that first searches for conflict scenarios (near-misses) then mutates them into actual collisions, improving collision discovery diversity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulation-based ADS testing focuses mainly on scenarios already close to collisions, leaving many hazardous situations unexplored. There's a need for more comprehensive safety evaluation that can discover diverse collision types efficiently.

Method: Introduces conflict as an intermediate search target between normal driving and collisions. Proposes a two-stage framework: 1) Search for conflict scenarios (near-miss situations), 2) Mutate these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions through targeted modifications.

Result: Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, the approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations due to conflict-targeted mutations.

Conclusion: Using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of autonomous driving system safety evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are safety-critical and require rigorous testing before public deployment. Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation.

### [3] [TurboADMM: A Structure-Exploiting Parallel Solver for Multi-Agent Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15838)
*Yucheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TurboADMM is a specialized QP solver for multi-agent trajectory optimization that achieves near-linear complexity in agent count by combining ADMM decomposition, Riccati warmstart, and parametric QP hotstart.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers for multi-agent trajectory optimization fail to simultaneously exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity. General-purpose QP solvers treat problems monolithically and scale poorly with agent count, while structure-exploiting solvers like HPIPM are vulnerable to dense coupling constraints.

Method: TurboADMM combines three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates parallelizable per-agent subproblems while preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart provides high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP by exploiting temporal structure; (3) parametric QP hotstart in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.

Result: The solver achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count, enabling efficient solution of large coupled QPs at control rates for multi-agent trajectory optimization problems with dense interaction networks.

Conclusion: TurboADMM successfully addresses the limitations of existing solvers by systematically co-designing decomposition, warmstarting, and factorization reuse techniques, providing an efficient solution for multi-agent trajectory optimization with dense coupling constraints.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory optimization with dense interaction networks require solving large coupled QPs at control rates, yet existing solvers fail to simultaneously exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity. One usually treats multi-agent problems monolithically when using general-purpose QP solvers (OSQP, MOSEK), which encounter scalability difficulties with agent count. Structure-exploiting solvers (HPIPM) leverage temporal structure through Riccati recursion but can be vulnerable to dense coupling constraints. We introduce TurboADMM, a specialized single-machine QP solver that achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count through systematic co-design of three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates per-agent subproblems solvable in parallel, preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart exploits temporal structure to provide high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP; (3) parametric QP hotstart \footnote{In the paper, we refer warmstart as the technique that uses the Riccati equation results as auxiliary QP initialization for a single QP solve, while hotstart as reusing the QR factorization across QP solve iterations.}in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.

### [4] [A Decade of Human-Robot Interaction through Immersive Lenses: A Literature Review on Extended Reality as a Research Instrument in Social Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15840)
*André Helgert,Carolin Straßmann,Sabrina C. Eimler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematic review of 33 empirical studies (2015-2025) reveals social XR-HRI research is dominated by lab simulations with underreported specifications, passive robot stimuli, untapped XR capabilities, and demographic homogeneity, proposing a 5-phase roadmap for maturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XR technologies have gained attention in HRI research but remain underexplored in empirical social robotics investigations, creating a need to systematically map the field and identify current limitations and opportunities for advancement.

Method: Systematic review of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles from 2015-2025, with 33 meeting strict inclusion criteria. Analysis examined: (1) XR and virtual social robot usage contexts, (2) data collection/analysis methods, (3) researcher/participant demographics, (4) stated challenges and future agendas.

Result: Social XR-HRI research is dominated by laboratory simulations with underreported hardware/software/robot specifications. Robots typically act as passive visual stimuli, with untapped XR capabilities like biosignal tracking. Research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, male, with demographic reporting gaps. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short study cycles.

Conclusion: Proposes a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium: fostering methodological innovation, enhancing ecological validity through application contexts, improving robot interaction quality, promoting sample diversity, and developing a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Essential for XR to mature from lab prototype to ecologically valid research instrument.

Abstract: Over the past decade, extended reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, gained attention as a research instrument in human-robot interaction studies, but remains underexplored in empirical investigations of social robotics. To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.

### [5] [ReasonNavi: Human-Inspired Global Map Reasoning for Zero-Shot Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15864)
*Yuzhuo Ao,Anbang Wang,Yu-Wing Tai,Chi-Keung Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReasonNavi is a zero-shot navigation framework that combines MLLMs for semantic reasoning with deterministic planners, using a human-inspired "reason-then-act" approach to overcome limitations of egocentric-only navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents relying on partial egocentric observations lack global foresight, leading to inefficient exploration. Humans plan using maps by reasoning globally first, then acting locally - a capability current navigation systems lack.

Method: ReasonNavi converts top-down maps into discrete reasoning spaces via room segmentation and candidate target sampling. MLLMs perform multi-stage reasoning to select optimal waypoints based on instructions, avoiding continuous coordinate prediction. Selected waypoints are grounded into executable trajectories using deterministic action planners over online-built occupancy maps, with pretrained object detectors for robust goal recognition.

Result: ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods requiring extensive training or heavy scene modeling across three navigation tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution without MLLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, interpretable navigation solution that leverages foundation model improvements, circumvents RL-based policy brittleness, and operationalizes human-like "reason-then-act" planning for embodied agents.

Abstract: Embodied agents often struggle with efficient navigation because they rely primarily on partial egocentric observations, which restrict global foresight and lead to inefficient exploration. In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

*Xunlan Zhou,Xuanlin Chen,Shaowei Zhang,Xiangkun Li,ShengHua Wan,Xiaohai Hu,Yuan Lei,Le Gan,De-chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MARVL improves robotic RL by using fine-tuned VLMs for multi-stage dense reward design, outperforming existing methods on Meta-World benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual engineering of dense reward functions limits RL scalability and automation. Naive VLM-based rewards suffer from misalignment with task progress, poor spatial grounding, and limited task semantic understanding.

Method: MARVL fine-tunes VLMs for spatial and semantic consistency, decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks, and uses task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity.

Result: MARVL significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MARVL provides an effective approach for automated dense reward design using VLMs, addressing key limitations of naive VLM rewards and enabling more scalable robotic RL.

Abstract: Designing dense reward functions is pivotal for efficient robotic Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, most dense rewards rely on manual engineering, which fundamentally limits the scalability and automation of reinforcement learning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to reward design, naive VLM rewards often misalign with task progress, struggle with spatial grounding, and show limited understanding of task semantics. To address these issues, we propose MARVL-Multi-stAge guidance for Robotic manipulation via Vision-Language models. MARVL fine-tunes a VLM for spatial and semantic consistency and decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks with task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity. Empirically, MARVL significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on the Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

### [7] [Test-Time Adaptation for Tactile-Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15873)
*Chuyang Ye,Haoxian Jing,Qinting Jiang,Yixi Lin,Qiang Li,Xing Tang,Jingyan Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reliability-aware test-time adaptation framework for tactile-vision-language models that estimates per-modality reliability to handle asynchronous cross-modal distribution shifts, improving robustness when some modalities become unreliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods lack explicit treatment of modality-wise reliability under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, making them brittle when some modalities become unreliable in real-world robotic and multimodal perception tasks.

Method: Proposes a reliability-aware framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses, using this signal to filter unreliable test samples, adaptively fuse tactile/visual/language features, and regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective.

Result: Outperforms strong TTA baselines on TAG-C benchmark and additional TVL scenarios, achieving accuracy gains of up to 49.9% under severe modality corruptions.

Conclusion: Explicit modality-wise reliability modeling is crucial for robust test-time adaptation in tactile-vision-language models facing asynchronous cross-modal distribution shifts.

Abstract: Tactile-vision-language (TVL) models are increasingly deployed in real-world robotic and multimodal perception tasks, where test-time distribution shifts are unavoidable. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods provide filtering in unimodal settings but lack explicit treatment of modality-wise reliability under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, leaving them brittle when some modalities become unreliable. We study TTA for TVL models under such shifts and propose a reliability-aware framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses. This shared reliability signal is used to (i) filter unreliable test samples, (ii) adaptively fuse tactile, visual, and language features, and (iii) regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective. On the TAG-C benchmark and additional TVL scenarios, our approach consistently outperforms strong TTA baselines, achieving accuracy gains of up to 49.9\% under severe modality corruptions, underscoring the importance of explicit modality-wise reliability modeling for robust test-time adaptation.

*Zhenxing Xu,Brikit Lu,Weidong Bao,Zhengqiu Zhu,Junsong Zhang,Hui Yan,Wenhao Lu,Ji Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fly0 is a VLN framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning using MLLMs for instruction grounding and geometric modules for 3D localization and trajectory planning, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods face a trade-off between semantic understanding and control precision, with MLLMs as low-level controllers suffering from high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) geometric projection module using depth data to localize targets in 3D space; (3) geometric planner for generating collision-free trajectories.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving Success Rate by over 20% and reducing Navigation Error by approximately 50% in unstructured environments, with reduced computational overhead and improved stability.

Conclusion: Fly0's decoupling approach enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost, eliminating continuous inference needs while maintaining semantic reasoning capabilities through MLLMs.

Abstract: Current Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) methodologies face a trade-off between semantic understanding and control precision. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer superior reasoning, deploying them as low-level controllers leads to high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding. To address these limitations, we propose Fly0, a framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning. The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the Success Rate by over 20\% and reducing Navigation Error (NE) by approximately 50\% in unstructured environments.

### [9] [The SLAM Confidence Trap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15884)
*Sebastian Sansoni,Santiago Ramón Tosetti Sanz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper critiques the SLAM community's overemphasis on benchmark accuracy at the expense of proper uncertainty estimation, arguing this creates brittle systems, and calls for prioritizing principled uncertainty computation as a key success metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SLAM community has prioritized geometric accuracy and benchmark scores while neglecting principled uncertainty estimation, leading to probabilistically inconsistent and brittle systems that lack proper confidence measures.

Method: The paper advocates for a paradigm shift rather than proposing a specific technical method. It calls for making consistent, real-time uncertainty computation a primary evaluation metric alongside traditional accuracy measures.

Result: The paper identifies a systemic issue in SLAM research - the "Confidence Trap" where systems achieve geometric accuracy but fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The SLAM community needs to prioritize principled uncertainty estimation as a core success metric alongside accuracy, moving beyond the current "Confidence Trap" to develop more robust and reliable systems.

Abstract: The SLAM community has fallen into a "Confidence Trap" by prioritizing benchmark scores over principled uncertainty estimation. This yields systems that are geometrically accurate but probabilitistically inconsistent and brittle. We advocate for a paradigm shift where the consistent, real-time computation of uncertainty becomes a primary metric of success.

*Zilin Wang,Saeed Rahmani,Daphne Cornelisse,Bidipta Sarkar,Alexander David Goldie,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Shimon Whiteson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NOMAD enables autonomous driving policy adaptation to new cities using only map data and self-play reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for costly human demonstrations in target cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous vehicle deployment to new cities is expensive and slow due to the requirement for extensive human demonstration data collection in each target city, which differs in road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns from training environments.

Method: NOMAD uses self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning in a simulator constructed from target-city map data, requiring only map and meta-information without human demonstrations, with a simple reward function to adapt driving policies.

Result: NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities compared to existing methods, demonstrating effective policy adaptation without target-city human data.

Conclusion: Self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning with map-based simulation provides an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods for autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: While autonomous vehicles have achieved reliable performance within specific operating regions, their deployment to new cities remains costly and slow. A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map. Using a simple reward function, NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods.

*Zhiyuan Ren,Yudong Fang,Tao Zhang,Wenchi Cheng,Ben Lan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes AsymmetricHuberEKF for UAV-based survivor localization in NLOS environments, addressing asymmetric ranging biases with a physically-grounded asymmetric loss function and active sensing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimators fail in post-disaster NLOS scenarios due to their reliance on symmetric error assumptions, leading to Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD) where persistent asymmetric biases coupled with limited observation geometry cause estimator stagnation.

Method: Develops AsymmetricHuberEKF that explicitly incorporates non-negative NLOS bias priors through an asymmetric loss function, and co-designs an active sensing strategy to provide necessary bilateral information for resolving SGD.

Result: Validated in 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, the approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, demonstrating resilience in data-scarce, geometry-constrained search operations.

Conclusion: The physically-grounded AsymmetricHuberEKF framework resolves the fundamental mismatch between symmetric estimators and asymmetric NLOS biases, offering a robust solution for UAV-based survivor localization in disaster scenarios where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Post-disaster survivor localization using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) faces a fundamental physical challenge: the prevalence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation in collapsed structures. Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.

Conclusion: SceneVGGT provides an efficient, scalable framework for spatio-temporal 3D scene understanding that combines SLAM with semantic mapping, making it suitable for real-time autonomous and assistive navigation applications with practical memory constraints.

Abstract: We present SceneVGGT, a spatio-temporal 3D scene understanding framework that combines SLAM with semantic mapping for autonomous and assistive navigation. Built on VGGT, our method scales to long video streams via a sliding-window pipeline. We align local submaps using camera-pose transformations, enabling memory- and speed-efficient mapping while preserving geometric consistency. Semantics are lifted from 2D instance masks to 3D objects using the VGGT tracking head, maintaining temporally coherent identities for change detection. As a proof of concept, object locations are projected onto an estimated floor plane for assistive navigation. The pipeline's GPU memory usage remains under 17 GB, irrespectively of the length of the input sequence and achieves competitive point-cloud performance on the ScanNet++ benchmark. Overall, SceneVGGT ensures robust semantic identification and is fast enough to support interactive assistive navigation with audio feedback.

TL;DR: Lightning is a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that uses relighting models, offline optimization, and imitation learning to intelligently control programmable onboard lighting to improve SLAM robustness while minimizing power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to robot perception under challenging lighting conditions (low light, high dynamic range) are limited by the captured image quality. While programmable onboard lighting could help, predicting its impact is complex due to nonlinear interactions with scene properties like depth, reflectance, and geometry, which can both reveal structure and create problems like specular highlights and saturation.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Train CLID (Co-Located Illumination Decomposition) model to decompose observations into ambient and light-contribution components for physically consistent synthesis of alternative lighting conditions; 2) Formulate offline OIS (Optimal Intensity Schedule) problem to select illumination levels trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness; 3) Distill optimal solution into real-time ILC (Illumination Control Policy) through behavior cloning for online deployment.

Result: Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power consumption across evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of intelligent illumination control for visual SLAM by combining relighting synthesis, offline optimization, and imitation learning to create a real-time controller that generalizes beyond initial training data and operates effectively on mobile robots.

Abstract: Robot perception under low light or high dynamic range is usually improved downstream - via more robust feature extraction, image enhancement, or closed-loop exposure control. However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework for autonomous sailboats that combines topological constraints and forecast-aware planning to handle anisotropic performance in inhomogeneous, time-varying ocean environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous sailboats are ideal for long-duration ocean observation but face challenges due to their anisotropic performance and sensitivity to inhomogeneous, time-varying wind/current fields. Existing coverage methods like boustrophedon sweeping are ineffective under these environmental and maneuvering constraints, creating a gap in planning solutions.

Method: A spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework with two key components: (1) topology-based morphological constraints in the spatial domain to ensure compact and continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in the temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making.

Result: Simulations under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments (including scenarios with partial directional accessibility) demonstrate that the proposed method generates efficient and feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail.

Conclusion: This study provides the first dedicated solution to coverage path planning for autonomous sailboats operating in inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage missions.

Abstract: Autonomous sailboats are well suited for long-duration ocean observation due to their wind-driven endurance. However, their performance is highly anisotropic and strongly influenced by inhomogeneous and time-varying wind and current fields, limiting the effectiveness of existing coverage methods such as boustrophedon sweeping. Planning under these environmental and maneuvering constraints remains underexplored. This paper presents a spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework tailored to autonomous sailboats, combining (1) topology-based morphological constraints in the spatial domain to promote compact and continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in the temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making. Simulations conducted under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, including scenarios with partial directional accessibility, demonstrate that the proposed method generates efficient and feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first dedicated solution to the coverage path planning problem for autonomous sailboats operating in inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage.

TL;DR: DreamZero is a World Action Model that uses video diffusion to learn physical dynamics, achieving 2x better generalization than VLAs, real-time 7Hz control, and cross-embodiment transfer with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with physical motion generalization in novel environments, as they focus on semantic understanding rather than learning physical dynamics.

Method: DreamZero builds on a pretrained video diffusion backbone to create a World Action Model that jointly predicts future world states and actions from video, learning diverse skills from heterogeneous robot data without repetitive demonstrations.

Result: Achieves over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks/environments vs state-of-the-art VLAs, enables real-time 7Hz closed-loop control with a 14B model, and demonstrates cross-embodiment transfer with 42% improvement from video-only demonstrations and few-shot adaptation with only 30 minutes of play data.

Conclusion: DreamZero's video-based World Action Model approach effectively learns physical dynamics, enabling superior generalization, real-time control, and efficient cross-embodiment transfer compared to traditional VLA models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: FUTURE-VLA is a unified vision-language-action architecture that enables real-time long-horizon robot control and future forecasting through efficient spatiotemporal compression and latent-space autoregression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for robots suffer from prohibitive latency when processing long video histories and generating high-dimensional future predictions, limiting their practical deployment for real-time control tasks.

Method: FUTURE-VLA reformulates long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task using a dual-sided efficiency paradigm: 1) temporally adaptive compression to maximize spatiotemporal information density for processing extensive multi-view histories, and 2) latent-space autoregression to align actionable dynamics with visual look-aheads in a single forward pass.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99.2% success on LIBERO, 75.4% on RoboTwin, and 78.0% on real-world Piper platform, while maintaining constant inference latency comparable to single-frame baselines despite processing 16× extended spatiotemporal windows.

Conclusion: FUTURE-VLA successfully bridges the gap between powerful vision-language reasoning capabilities and practical robot deployment by enabling real-time long-horizon control with interpretable future previews and interactive human validation mechanisms.

Abstract: General vision-language models increasingly support unified spatiotemporal reasoning over long video streams, yet deploying such capabilities on robots remains constrained by the prohibitive latency of processing long-horizon histories and generating high-dimensional future predictions. To bridge this gap, we present FUTURE-VLA, a unified architecture that reformulates long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task. Adopting a dual-sided efficiency paradigm, FUTURE-VLA leverages a temporally adaptive compression strategy to maximize spatiotemporal information density, enabling the ingestion of extensive multi-view histories while maintaining constant inference latency. Simultaneously, it performs latent-space autoregression to align actionable dynamics with reviewable visual look-aheads in a single forward pass. These real-time predictive capabilities further enable a prediction-guided Human-In-the-Loop mechanism via interactive execution gating, allowing operators to dynamically validate behaviors based on interpretable future previews. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FUTURE-VLA establishes new state-of-the-art performance, attaining success rates of 99.2% on LIBERO, 75.4% on RoboTwin, and 78.0% on a real-world Piper platform, all with a $16\times$ extended spatiotemporal window while maintaining the inference latency of a single-frame baseline.

TL;DR: PINNs outperform purely data-driven models for spacecraft attitude dynamics, reducing prediction error by 68.17% and improving MPC performance with faster settling times and better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spacecraft attitude dynamics models are crucial for MPC performance, but physics-based models are difficult/computationally heavy for complex systems, while purely data-driven models suffer from fragile stability and poor extrapolation.

Method: Two learning approaches compared: 1) purely data-driven pipeline, and 2) physics-regularized approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporate prior knowledge into optimization. High-fidelity numerical simulations generate comprehensive dataset.

Result: Physics-informed models achieve 68.17% decrease in mean relative error compared to data-driven approach. In MPC deployment, they show superior closed-loop tracking, improved robustness to uncertainty, and hybrid control formulation reduces settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under noise and friction.

Conclusion: Embedding physical constraints during training substantially improves predictive reliability and control performance for spacecraft attitude dynamics, making PINNs a promising alternative to both purely physics-based and purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction.

By providing a psychological foundation and practical framework, it enables researchers to move beyond purely technical enhancements and better align robotic systems with human intentions in collaborative scenarios.

Abstract: Despite a surge in robotics research dedicated to inferring and understanding human intent, a universally accepted definition remains elusive since existing works often equate human intention with specific task-related goals.

TL;DR: ScenicRules is a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems using prioritized multi-objective specifications and formal environment models in stochastic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving benchmarks lack combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models needed to evaluate complex traffic scenarios where objectives conflict and require explicit priority relations.

Method: 1) Formalize diverse objectives as quantitative metrics; 2) Design Hierarchical Rulebook framework encoding multiple objectives with priority relations; 3) Construct representative scenarios in Scenic language spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations.

Result: Experimental results show formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments, and the benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to prioritized objectives.

Conclusion: ScenicRules provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems under prioritized multi-objective specifications with formal environment modeling, addressing limitations of existing evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how uncertainty calibration in perception affects autonomous vehicle planning, finding that uncertainty-aware planners generalize better to complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need to account for perception uncertainty in decision-making, but current uncertainty-aware planners may be sensitive to miscalibration, which hasn't been well characterized.

Method: Comparative analysis of two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying uncertainty propagation levels on the nuPlan benchmark, using closed-loop evaluation to study uncertainty calibration impact.

Result: The method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios compared to approaches with less uncertainty handling.

Conclusion: Proper uncertainty propagation from perception to planning is crucial for robust autonomous vehicle performance, especially in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being increasingly deployed in urban environments. In order to operate safely and reliably, AVs need to account for the inherent uncertainty associated with perceiving the world through sensor data and incorporate that into their decision-making process. Uncertainty-aware planners have recently been developed to account for upstream perception and prediction uncertainty. However, such planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, the magnitude of which has not yet been characterized. Towards this end, we perform a detailed analysis on the impact that perceptual uncertainty propagation and calibration has on perception-based motion planning. We do so by comparing two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying levels of uncertainty propagation on the recently-released nuPlan planning benchmark. We study the impact of upstream uncertainty calibration using closed-loop evaluation on the nuPlan challenge scenarios. We find that the method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios.

Abstract: Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints.

TL;DR: MoMa-SG is a framework that builds semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs from RGB-D sequences to enable robots to understand and manipulate articulated objects in real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in real-world environments lack the ability to anticipate object motion, creating a gap between semantic understanding (what objects are) and kinematic understanding (how objects move). Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires bridging semantics, geometry, and kinematics.

Method: The framework processes RGB-D sequences with object articulations by: 1) temporally segmenting object interactions, 2) inferring object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking, 3) lifting point trajectories to 3D, 4) estimating articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation for revolute and prismatic joints, 5) associating objects with articulations, and 6) detecting contained objects via parent-child reasoning at opening states.

Result: The approach is evaluated on two datasets including the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset (62 sequences, 600 interactions, hierarchical semantics). Experiments show robust articulation estimation and real-world manipulation capabilities on both a quadruped and mobile manipulator in home environments.

Conclusion: MoMa-SG successfully bridges the gap between semantics and kinematics, enabling robots to build comprehensive semantic-kinematic scene graphs that support robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday environments.

Abstract: Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust in-hand manipulation by preventing object slip under external perturbations through rapid adaptation of internal grasp forces, combining the strengths of model-based control with learned tactile sensing.

Method: Multimodal tactile stack with piezoelectric sensing for fast slip detection (20ms onset) and piezoresistive arrays for contact localization; online construction of grasp matrix; slip-triggered force updates via quadratic program in null space of grasp while preserving object wrench and respecting actuation limits.

Result: Theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40ms (5ms for contact/geometry updates, ~4ms for QP solve); demonstrated closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under perturbations; measured delays dominated by experimental data path, not computation; clear path to sub-50ms closed-loop stabilization.

Conclusion: Combining efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reaction times for slip prevention, enabling practical closed-loop stabilization for in-hand manipulation with multifingered robotic grippers.

Abstract: We present a hybrid learning and model-based approach that adapts internal grasp forces to halt in-hand slip on a multifingered robotic gripper. A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation. Measured delays are dominated by the experimental data path rather than actual computation. The analysis outlines a clear route to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization.

TL;DR: RoboGene is an agentic framework that automates generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks for robots, addressing the scarcity of real-world robotic interaction data through automated task curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation suffers from limited real-world interaction data due to high physical collection costs. Manual task curation is unscalable and biased, while foundation models often produce physically infeasible instructions, creating a need for automated, high-quality task generation.

Method: RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. It generates tasks for single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots.

Result: The framework collected 18k trajectories in real-world experiments and significantly outperformed state-of-the-art foundation models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene data achieved higher success rates and superior generalization.

Conclusion: RoboGene successfully automates generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks, demonstrating the importance of high-quality task generation for robotic learning and enabling more efficient data collection for general-purpose manipulation.

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable Autonomous Guided Forklifts (AGFs) to automatically insert forks into pallet holes by accurately measuring pallet position/orientation and establishing coordinate system relationships for precise fork control.

Method: Uses a wide-angle camera fixed at the forklift backrest to capture pallet images. Proposes two image measurement methods: 1) measuring pallet pitch inclination in camera coordinates, and 2) acquiring calibration information between camera and fork coordinate systems.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed errors within allowable range for safe fork insertion across varying conditions including pallet pitch inclination angle, relative height between pallet and fork, and loaded/unloaded pallet states.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-based measurement and calibration methods enable accurate fork positioning for AGFs, achieving sufficient precision for safe autonomous pallet handling operations.

Abstract: In order to insert a fork into a hole of a pallet by a forklift located in front of a pallet, it is necessary to control the height position, reach position, and tilt angle of the fork to match the position and orientation of the hole of the pallet. In order to make AGF (Autonomous Guided Forklift) do this automatically, we propose an image measurement method to measure the pitch inclination of the pallet in the camera coordinate system from an image obtained by using a wide-angle camera. In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-robot SLAM faces challenges in data association and loop closure detection due to perceptual aliasing and perspective differences. Existing solutions using calibrated fiducial marker arrays have limited range and fail under challenging lighting conditions like reflections or overexposure.

Method: Proposes a novel solution leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. Features markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system, eliminating the need for fiducial markers.

Result: Demonstrates benefit to relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.

Conclusion: Markerless deep learning-based pose estimation provides a robust alternative to fiducial marker arrays for multi-robot SLAM, improving relative localization in challenging environments while overcoming limitations of traditional marker-based approaches.

Abstract: The capability of multi-robot SLAM approaches to merge localization history and maps from different observers is often challenged by the difficulty in establishing data association. Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biohybrid actuators using skeletal muscle tissue show promise for soft robotics but suffer from biological variability and nonlinearity, making them difficult to control and predict.

Method: Developed two modeling approaches: 1) Static prediction models (random forest and neural network regressors) to estimate maximum exerted force from input variables; 2) Dynamic modeling using Long Short-Term Memory networks as a digital twin to replicate force time series in response to electrical stimulation.

Result: Both modeling approaches achieved high predictive accuracy: static models achieved R² of 0.9425, dynamic LSTM model achieved R² of 0.9956.

Conclusion: Static models enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robust adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle-based biohybrid actuators have proved to be a promising component in soft robotics, offering efficient movement. However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative transportation with multiple robots is challenging in narrow environments where feasible regions are extremely limited, requiring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration that existing methods struggle to achieve.

Method: Models the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game with collision avoidance as constraints. Introduces cost-advantage decomposition to enforce team constraint sum below an upper bound, and constraint allocation method to assign shared constraints to individual robots for autonomous task-assignment.

Result: Simulation and real-time experiments demonstrate superior performance and higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed safe RL approach with constraint decomposition and allocation effectively addresses collaborative transportation challenges in narrow environments, ensuring safety while optimizing task performance through autonomous robot coordination.

Abstract: Collaborative transportation, where multiple robots collaboratively transport a payload, has garnered significant attention in recent years. While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate and efficient system identification method for robots that can jointly estimate state trajectories and physical parameters while handling complex constraints like inverse dynamics, contact constraints, and friction models.

Method: Bayesian framework with hard equality constraints for physically consistent inverse dynamics, contact/loop-closure constraints, and friction models; uses energy-based regressors for parameter observability; supports equality/inequality priors; enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections; augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations; employs parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion for linear complexity.

Result: Demonstrated faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines in simulation and hardware experiments on Unitree B1 with Z1 arm; improved tracking performance in model predictive control during locomotion over challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian system identification framework provides an accurate, scalable solution for joint state and parameter estimation in robotics, with practical benefits for model-based control applications.

Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian system identification (SysID) framework for jointly estimating robot's state trajectories and physical parameters with high accuracy. It embeds physically consistent inverse dynamics, contact and loop-closure constraints, and fully featured joint friction models as hard, stage-wise equality constraints. It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments.

TL;DR: Development of a resident underwater monitoring system using a mini-ROV with autonomous docking and inspection capabilities at 90m depth, achieving 90% docking success and 4-minute mission completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ocean monitoring is limited by sparse observations due to high costs and logistical constraints of underwater monitoring. Systems rely on sporadic surveys or fixed measurements, lacking persistent autonomous operations without continuous surface support. Resident underwater vehicles face challenges in autonomy, resilience, and robustness for long-term deployment in harsh environments.

Method: Developed a resident infrastructure with docking station and mini-class ROV at 90m depth. Enhanced ROV with onboard processing and perception for autonomous navigation using USBL signals, ArUco marker-based visual localization fused through Extended Kalman Filter, and local inspection routines. System enables untethered operations with acoustic and visual navigation integration.

Result: Achieved 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes. Demonstrated reliable integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions at depth.

Conclusion: Reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible with resident ROV systems. This approach enables scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring by overcoming limitations of current sparse observation methods through autonomous persistent operations.

Abstract: Our understanding of the oceans remains limited by sparse and infrequent observations, primarily because current methods are constrained by the high cost and logistical effort of underwater monitoring, relying either on sporadic surveys across broad areas or on long-term measurements at fixed locations. To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring.

TL;DR: First markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators using multi-feature fusion and rendering-based refinement with sim-to-real adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum manipulators in endoscopic surgery face pose estimation challenges due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited sensing. Vision-based methods have geometric observability limitations and computational overhead that hinder real-time closed-loop control.

Method: Unified framework with: 1) photo-realistic simulation for large-scale training, 2) stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network using segmentation, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes, 3) feed-forward rendering-based refinement module for geometric consistency, and 4) self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation with unlabeled data.

Result: Real-world validation achieved 0.83 mm mean translation error and 2.76° mean rotation error across 1,000 samples. Markerless visual servoing achieved 2.07 mm translation error and 7.41° rotation error, representing 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, with high repeatability.

Conclusion: First fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators enables precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing, addressing key challenges in flexible endoscopic surgery.

Abstract: Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots.

Abstract: SLOT (Soft Legged Omnidirectional Tetrapod), a tendon-driven soft quadruped robot with 3D-printed TPU legs, is presented to study physics-informed modeling and control of compliant legged locomotion using only four actuators. Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reactive motion generation approaches suffer from limitations in handling dynamic and unstructured scenarios due to static perception assumptions and inadequate modeling of system dynamics. There's a need to better model dynamic obstacles and optimize collision-free trajectories under perceptual and control uncertainty.

Method: The method introduces: 1) A tensorized particle weight update scheme for efficient particle-based perception that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance; 2) An obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics to predict and evaluate future system motion under uncertainty.

Result: The model predictive method significantly improves safety and reactivity in dynamic surroundings. The complete framework demonstrates consistent performance enhancement over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines in both simulated and noisy real-world environments when avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics through tight coupling of dynamic perception and model predictive planning consistently enhances manipulator performance in dynamic environments, outperforming existing approaches that treat perception and planning as separate components.

Abstract: Reactive motion generation in dynamic and unstructured scenarios is typically subject to essentially static perception and system dynamics. Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified fall recovery approach for humanoids that uses privileged teacher training with human demonstrations and perceptual-motor representations to achieve zero-shot generalization across complex terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoids face unique challenges during falls including high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes, making reliable recovery essential. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems or rely on end-to-end policies trained on flat terrain, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, then distill it into a deployable student that uses only egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation that combines next target pose with local terrain.

Result: Demonstrates robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid without real-world fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unifies all phases of fall recovery by leveraging constrained natural human poses and integrated perceptual-motor representations, achieving generalization across complex terrains without exhaustive training data.

Abstract: Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized approaches for multi-robot coordination scale poorly, and external localization systems may not always be available, necessitating decentralized solutions that rely only on onboard sensors.

Method: Block coordinate descent approach for localization without strict coordination between robots, and novel formation control formulation as inference on factor graphs that accounts for state estimation uncertainty.

Result: Achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrated through multiple real experiments with formation flights.

Conclusion: The approach provides completely decentralized range-aided localization and formation-based navigation that doesn't require specialized trajectories, offering a scalable solution for multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: Controlling a team of robots in a coordinated manner is challenging because centralized approaches (where all computation is performed on a central machine) scale poorly, and globally referenced external localization systems may not always be available. In this work, we consider the problem of range-aided decentralized localization and formation control. In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy. We demonstrate our approach through multiple real experiments involving formation flights in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to determine optimal sensor parameters (measurement schedules and noise covariances) needed to achieve specific trajectory estimation accuracy for mobile robots, formulated as semidefinite programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory estimation accuracy depends on sensor parameters (noise covariance and measurement rate), but cost/resource constraints limit sensor capabilities. There's a need to systematically determine what sensor parameters are required to achieve specific estimation accuracy targets.

Method: Formulate the problem of estimating required sensor schedules (measurement rates) and sensor covariances as semidefinite programs (SDPs). These optimization problems can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers to determine the necessary sensor parameters for desired estimation accuracy.

Result: The proposed method successfully calculates sensor schedules and covariances that achieve desired trajectory estimation accuracy in both simulation and real experiments. It also identifies scenarios where certain accuracy levels are unachievable with given system and sensor characteristics.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic approach to determine sensor parameter requirements for achieving specific trajectory estimation accuracy, enabling informed sensor selection and scheduling decisions under resource constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics.

*Xihan Ma,Haichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous robotic ultrasound system uses template-guided optimal pivoting for efficient kidney imaging, reducing probe footprint by 75mm compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional freehand ultrasound imaging suffers from operator-dependent inconsistencies, lack of 3D localization, and musculoskeletal risks. Existing robotic systems lack ability to determine optimal imaging windows, leading to excessive probe footprint, acoustic shadowing, and incomplete organ coverage.

Method: Autonomous workflow with template-guided optimal pivoting: 1) Explorative imaging to generate partial kidney observations, 2) Registration to kidney template to estimate organ pose, 3) Fixed-point pivoting sweep with imaging plane aligned to kidney long axis to minimize probe translation.

Result: Simulation: 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo: Kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Optimal pivoting shortened probe footprint by ~75 mm compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed template-guided optimal pivoting approach enables efficient kidney imaging by minimizing probe footprint while maintaining coverage, validating the use of anatomical templates for optimal probe alignment in volumetric sweeps.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep.

*Jack Rome,Stephen James,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for in-air cloth manipulation using a modified DreamerV2 architecture with surface normals input, enhanced replay buffer, and data augmentation to handle complex cloth physics and improve generalization across different cloth types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloth manipulation is a challenging robotic problem due to complex deformable object physics, with applications in assistive care and service industries. Existing approaches struggle with generalization across diverse cloth shapes, sizes, fold patterns, and appearance variations, necessitating improved model structures for better generalization performance.

Method: The authors adapt the DreamerV2 reinforcement learning architecture with three key modifications: 1) incorporation of surface normals input to better capture cloth geometry, 2) enhanced replay buffer design, and 3) improved data augmentation procedures. These modifications collectively enhance the world model's ability to represent the complex physics of deformable cloth objects.

Result: The approach was evaluated both in simulation and through zero-shot deployment on physical robots. The system successfully performed in-air unfolding of various cloth types, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities compared to baseline methods. The modifications enabled effective handling of different cloth materials and configurations without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed DreamerV2 modifications effectively address the challenges of cloth manipulation by enhancing the world model's representation of complex deformable object physics. The approach shows promising generalization across diverse cloth types and demonstrates the importance of carefully designed model architectures for handling the physical complexity of deformable objects in robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HERO: A new paradigm for humanoid robot object loco-manipulation combining large vision models for scene understanding with accurate end-effector control from simulated training, enabling manipulation of diverse everyday objects in real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-world imitation learning approaches for humanoid robot loco-manipulation suffer from limited generalization due to difficulty collecting large-scale training datasets. There's a need for systems that combine strong visual scene understanding with precise control capabilities.

Method: Developed HERO system with: 1) Accurate residual-aware end-effector tracking policy combining inverse kinematics, learned neural forward model, goal adjustment, and replanning; 2) Modular architecture using open-vocabulary large vision models for visual generalization; 3) Simulated training for control performance.

Result: Achieved 3.2x reduction in end-effector tracking error. System successfully operates in diverse real-world environments (offices, coffee shops) manipulating various everyday objects (mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm height. Demonstrated effectiveness through systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and real world.

Conclusion: HERO presents a novel paradigm combining large vision models' generalization capabilities with simulated training for precise control, enabling humanoid robots to reliably manipulate diverse objects in real-world environments. This approach opens new ways for training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

Abstract: Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EgoScale framework leverages large-scale egocentric human video data (20,854 hours) to train VLA models for dexterous manipulation, showing log-linear scaling laws and enabling effective transfer to robotic hands with minimal robot supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human behavior provides scalable data for learning physical intelligence, but it's unclear how to effectively leverage large-scale human data for fine-grained, high-DoF dexterous manipulation. Prior work only demonstrated transfer in constrained settings.

Method: EgoScale framework trains Vision Language Action (VLA) models on 20,854 hours of action-labeled egocentric human video (20× larger than prior work). Uses two-stage transfer: large-scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human-robot mid-training.

Result: Uncovered log-linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss, which strongly correlates with downstream robot performance. Achieved 54% average success rate improvement over no-pretraining baseline using 22-DoF dexterous hand. Transfers effectively to lower-DoF hands.

Conclusion: Large-scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment-agnostic motor prior for dexterous manipulation. The framework enables strong long-horizon manipulation and one-shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision through scalable human data utilization.

Abstract: Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.

*Zhenyu Wei,Yunchao Yao,Mingyu Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified parameterized canonical representation for dexterous hands that enables cross-embodiment policy learning by standardizing morphological and kinematic variations into a shared representation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dexterous manipulation policies assume fixed hand designs, severely limiting generalization to new embodiments with different kinematic and structural layouts. There's a need for a framework that can unify diverse hand architectures to enable cross-embodiment learning.

Method: Introduces a parameterized canonical representation with: 1) unified parameter space capturing morphological/kinematic variations, 2) structured latent manifold for smooth morphology transitions, and 3) canonical URDF format standardizing action space while preserving dynamic properties. Uses VAE for latent encoding and trains grasping policies conditioned on the canonical representation.

Result: Demonstrates successful cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer with 81.9% success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand. Validates through grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment experiments in simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies both representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation policies today largely assume fixed hand designs, severely restricting their generalization to new embodiments with varied kinematic and structural layouts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaR is a novel constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers that uses explicit learning-based feasibility refinement to efficiently handle hard constraints through joint training of construction and lightweight improvement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural solvers excel at simple routing problems but struggle with complex constraints. Existing constraint-handling methods (feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness) are inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints, limiting neural solvers' applicability to real-world constrained routing problems.

Method: CaR (Construct-and-Refine) framework features: 1) Joint training framework guiding construction module to generate diverse, high-quality solutions suitable for lightweight improvement; 2) Lightweight refinement process (e.g., 10 steps vs 5k in prior work); 3) Construction-improvement-shared representation unifying encoder for knowledge sharing across paradigms; 4) Explicit learning-based feasibility refinement for general constraint handling.

Result: CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers on typical hard routing constraints, demonstrating broader applicability in complex constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: CaR provides the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers, enabling effective handling of hard constraints through explicit learning-based feasibility refinement and joint training of construction and lightweight improvement modules with shared representations.

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous prompt optimization can paradoxically degrade classifier performance through optimization instability, especially for low-prevalence conditions, where retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate optimization instability in autonomous agentic workflows where continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, particularly in clinical symptom detection with varying prevalence rates.

Method: Used Pythia framework for automated prompt optimization on three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (23%, 12%, 3%). Evaluated validation sensitivity oscillations across iterations. Tested two interventions: guiding agent for active redirection and selector agent for retrospective identification of best-performing iteration.

Result: Validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases. Selector agent successfully prevented catastrophic failure and outperformed expert-curated lexicons by 331% (F1) for brain fog and 7% for chest pain.

Conclusion: Optimization instability is a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems, particularly for low-prevalence classification tasks. Retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization, demonstrating that simple oversight mechanisms can significantly improve autonomous system reliability.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

TL;DR: Benchmarking uncertainty quantification methods for LLM-based automatic assessment in education, analyzing uncertainty patterns across datasets, models, and decoding strategies to inform development of reliable uncertainty-aware grading systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are transforming automatic assessment in education but introduce output uncertainty due to their probabilistic nature. Unreliable uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable pedagogical interventions and negative learning consequences, necessitating systematic understanding of uncertainty quantification methods in educational settings.

Method: Benchmarking a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in LLM-based automatic assessment. Comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings. Evaluation of uncertainty metrics and analysis of key factors including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies.

Result: Characterization of uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Identification of strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics. Analysis of how model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies influence uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights into uncertainty characteristics in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays groundwork for developing more reliable uncertainty-aware grading systems, addressing a critical gap in educational technology research.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to train LLMs' interactive learning ability through multi-turn didactic interactions, transforming static knowledge acquisition into dynamic feedback-driven adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training relies on modeling static corpora, overlooking interactive feedback loops essential for dynamic context adaptation, while human learning excels at adapting thought processes based on corrective feedback in collaborative settings.

Method: A scalable method transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry, training models to integrate corrective feedback and predict teacher critiques to enable self-correction.

Result: Models trained with this approach dramatically improve interactive learning from language feedback, with smaller models nearly matching larger ones; robust cross-domain generalization occurs from math to coding/puzzles/mazes; models gain self-correction capability.

Conclusion: Interactive in-context learning can be trained as a distinct skill, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt through feedback, achieve self-improvement via internalized critique modeling, and bridge the gap between static knowledge acquisition and human-like adaptive learning.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPSBench is a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs' geospatial reasoning capabilities across 17 tasks, revealing models struggle with geometric computations but perform better on real-world geographic reasoning, with hierarchical knowledge degradation from country to city level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in physical world applications (navigation, robotics, mapping), making robust geospatial reasoning critical, yet their ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored.

Method: Introduced GPSBench dataset with 57,800 samples across 17 tasks evaluating both geometric coordinate operations (distance/bearing computation) and reasoning integrating coordinates with world knowledge. Evaluated 14 state-of-the-art LLMs focusing on intrinsic capabilities rather than tool use.

Result: GPS reasoning remains challenging with substantial task variation: models more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically (strong country-level, weak city-level). Robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine understanding rather than memorization. GPS-coordinate augmentation improves downstream tasks, while finetuning creates trade-offs between geometric computation gains and world knowledge degradation.

Conclusion: Geospatial reasoning is a critical but challenging capability for LLMs, with GPSBench providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Models show genuine coordinate understanding but need improvement in geometric computations and fine-grained localization. Dataset enables reproducible evaluation and development of better geospatial reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

TL;DR: PAHF framework enables AI agents to continuously personalize through explicit user memory and dual feedback channels, outperforming static approaches in learning and adapting to evolving preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI agents fail to align with individual users' idiosyncratic, evolving preferences. Static approaches using implicit models or external memory struggle with new users and changing preferences over time.

Method: PAHF framework with three-step loop: (1) pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from explicit per-user memory, (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory for preference drift. Uses dual feedback channels and explicit memory.

Result: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms no-memory and single-channel baselines. Reduces initial personalization error and enables rapid adaptation to preference shifts in embodied manipulation and online shopping benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical for continual personalization. PAHF framework effectively addresses limitations of static approaches by enabling online learning from live interaction with explicit per-user memory.

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

TL;DR: Training AI agents on high-fidelity enterprise simulation environments produces capabilities that transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks, with CoreCraft environment showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution, particularly for complex enterprise tasks.

Method: Introduced CoreCraft, a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization with over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types and 23 unique tools. Trained GLM 4.6 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with adaptive clipping on this environment.

Result: After single epoch training, task pass rate improved from 25.37% to 36.76% on held-out evaluation tasks. Gains transferred to OOD benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on τ²-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). Frontier models like GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solved fewer than 30% of tasks.

Conclusion: Environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities. Three environment properties enable transfer: task-centric world building, expert-authored rubrics for reliable reward computation, and realistic enterprise workflows.

Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes alternative memory approaches for ASI beyond the dominant "extract then store" paradigm, emphasizing "store then on-demand extract" to avoid information loss, plus probabilistic experience analysis and experience sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASI memory approaches follow an "extract then store" paradigm that risks losing valuable information during extraction, particularly knowledge useful for different tasks. The authors aim to explore alternative memory design concepts that could better support artificial superintelligence development.

Method: The paper focuses on conceptual exploration rather than novel methods, examining three alternative approaches: 1) "store then on-demand extract" (retaining raw experiences for flexible application), 2) discovering deeper insights from probabilistic experiences, and 3) improving experience collection efficiency through sharing. Simple experiments validate these approaches.

Result: Simple experiments demonstrate that the proposed alternative memory approaches are indeed effective, though the paper doesn't specify detailed experimental results. The approaches show promise for avoiding information loss and improving memory utilization.

Conclusion: The paper identifies major challenges limiting investigation into these promising memory directions and proposes research topics to address them. The "store then on-demand extract" paradigm and related approaches offer valuable alternatives to current memory design for ASI development.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

TL;DR: Proxy State-Based Evaluation: LLM-driven simulation framework for evaluating interactive LLM agents without deterministic backends, using proxy state inference and LLM judges to verify goal completion and detect hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic benchmarks require costly deterministic backends that are difficult to build and iterate. Need for benchmarks that reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data without deterministic databases.

Method: Scenario specification with user goal, facts, expected final state, and behavior. LLM state tracker infers structured proxy state from interaction trace. LLM judges verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints.

Result: Benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts. On-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Near-zero simulator hallucination rates. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%.

Conclusion: Proxy state-based evaluation offers practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents, enabling reliable automated evaluation without costly deterministic backends.

Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

TL;DR: Sequence models trained with diverse co-players develop in-context learning awareness and cooperative behaviors without hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for inducing cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning rely on hardcoded assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce strict timescale separation between naive learners and meta-learners, which limits scalability and flexibility.

Method: Train sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players using standard decentralized reinforcement learning, leveraging the models' in-context learning capabilities to develop best-response strategies that function as learning algorithms on fast intra-episode timescales.

Result: Sequence models naturally develop in-context best-response strategies and learning awareness. The cooperative mechanism from prior work (vulnerability to extortion driving mutual shaping) emerges naturally: in-context adaptation makes agents vulnerable to extortion, and mutual pressure to shape opponents' in-context learning dynamics leads to cooperative behavior.

Conclusion: Standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation.

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

*Philipp Schoenegger,Matt Carlson,Chris Schneider,Chris Daly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A certification protocol for multiagent AI systems that verifies shared understanding of terms using statistical testing on observable events, enabling provably bounded disagreement through core-guarded reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiagent AI systems need consistent communication but lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of terms. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque.

Method: Proposes a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model where agents are tested on shared observable events. Terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. Agents restrict reasoning to certified terms (core-guarded reasoning) to achieve provably bounded disagreement. Includes mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation).

Result: In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication by ensuring shared understanding of terms through statistical certification and core-guarded reasoning.

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Wangyang Ying,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAFE reformulates automated feature engineering as a causally-guided sequential decision process, combining causal discovery with reinforcement learning to create more robust features under distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics that produce brittle features that fail under distribution shift. There's a need for more robust feature engineering that incorporates causal understanding to improve generalization.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase I learns sparse DAG over features and target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on causal influence. Phase II uses cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies favoring causally plausible transformations while controlling complexity.

Result: Across 15 public benchmarks: 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduced episodes-to-convergence, competitive time-to-target. Under covariate shift: 4x reduction in performance drop relative to non-causal multi-agent baseline, more compact feature sets, more stable post-hoc attributions.

Conclusion: Causal structure used as a soft inductive prior rather than rigid constraint can substantially improve robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering, enabling more stable performance under distribution shift.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

TL;DR: LLMs used as imperfect experts to provide semantic structural priors for Causal ABA framework, achieving SOTA performance on benchmarks with new evaluation protocol to mitigate memorization bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery requires expert knowledge for principled graph construction, but many statistical methods rely solely on observational data. Causal ABA offers symbolic reasoning framework but needs expert input. LLMs can serve as imperfect experts to provide semantic priors from variable descriptions.

Method: Use LLMs to elicit semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions, then integrate these with conditional-independence evidence within the Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) framework. Introduces evaluation protocol to mitigate LLM memorization bias.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs. The evaluation protocol effectively addresses memorization concerns when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as imperfect experts in causal discovery when integrated with formal frameworks like Causal ABA, combining semantic understanding with statistical evidence while addressing memorization bias through proper evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

TL;DR: Framework of Thoughts (FoT) is a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes that addresses limitations of static prompting approaches through built-in optimization features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting schemes like Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts have limitations: they require static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problems, and they are under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost.

Method: Introduces Framework of Thoughts (FoT) - a general-purpose foundation framework with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching. The framework enables implementation of various reasoning schemes (demonstrated with Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree) while providing optimization capabilities.

Result: Empirical demonstration shows FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. The framework successfully implements three popular reasoning schemes and demonstrates performance improvements across multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: FoT provides a comprehensive solution for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes, addressing key limitations of existing prompting approaches. The framework unlocks latent performance potential through systematic optimization and offers a foundation for developing future efficient reasoning schemes.

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

TL;DR: A poetry workshop with iterative expert feedback shaped an LLM into a digital poet that produced poems indistinguishable from human poetry in blinded tests, leading to commercial publication and raising questions about creativity and authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether machines can write good poetry and investigate fundamental questions about the nature and value of art, creativity, and authorship in the context of AI-generated content.

Method: A seven-month poetry workshop using iterative in-context expert feedback to shape a large language model into a digital poet without retraining, followed by quantitative and qualitative analyses of the developed style and corpus, and a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students/graduates.

Result: The model developed a distinctive style and coherent corpus, created a pen name and author image, and in blinded tests, human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52% (both with 95% CIs including 50%), showing chance-level discrimination. A commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model.

Conclusion: Workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping of AI systems and renews debates on creativity and authorship, demonstrating that AI can produce poetry indistinguishable from human work in controlled evaluations.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

TL;DR: Agent Skill framework benefits small language models (SLMs), especially 12B-30B parameter models, improving performance in data-sensitive industrial scenarios where API reliance is infeasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Agent Skill framework shows strong performance with proprietary models but its effectiveness with small language models (SLMs) remains unexplored. This matters for industrial applications where continuous public API use is infeasible due to data security and budget constraints, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in customized scenarios.

Method: Introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases including two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims dataset.

Result: Tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings provide comprehensive characterization of Agent Skill framework capabilities and constraints, offering actionable insights for effective deployment in SLM-centered environments, particularly for industrial applications with data security and budget limitations.

Abstract: Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 12 metrics across 4 dimensions (consistency, robustness, predictability, safety) to holistically evaluate AI agent reliability beyond single success metrics, revealing persistent limitations despite capability gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent evaluations focus on single success metrics that obscure critical operational flaws, creating a discrepancy between benchmark performance and practical failures. There's a need for more comprehensive reliability assessment.

Method: Proposes 12 concrete metrics decomposing agent reliability along four dimensions: consistency (behavior across runs), robustness (withstand perturbations), predictability (failure patterns), and safety (error severity bounds). Evaluates 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks.

Result: Recent capability gains have yielded only small improvements in reliability. The metrics expose persistent limitations that traditional evaluations miss, showing agents still lack consistent, robust, predictable, and safe behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed holistic performance profile complements traditional evaluations by providing tools to reason about how agents perform, degrade, and fail, addressing fundamental limitations of current single-metric assessments.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.
