### [1] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Continuous Navigation via Memory-Augmented Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11183)
*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian filtering framework for UAV navigation that addresses state drift by decoupling navigation into prior prediction and likelihood correction, using attention-based retrieval for error correction without gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Navigation models for UAVs suffer from accumulated position errors due to dead-reckoning approaches, leading to state drift where internal belief diverges from objective coordinates, compromising trajectory prediction accuracy.

Method: Formulates sequential prediction as recursive Bayesian state estimation, decoupling navigation into Prior Prediction (based on motion dynamics) and Likelihood Correction (from historical observation). Associates Kernel Density Estimation of measurement likelihood with attention-based retrieval mechanism to rectify latent representations using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate clear outperformance over strong baselines with only 10% of training data fine-tuning, effectively regulating drift accumulation.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman provides an effective Bayesian filtering framework that addresses state drift in UAV navigation by combining motion dynamics with historical observation correction, enabling more accurate continuous navigation in complex environments with minimal training data requirements.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

### [2] [H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291)
*Wenyuan Chen,Jinbang Huang,Oscar Pang,Zhiyuan Li,Xiao Hu,Lingfeng Zhang,Zhanguang Zhang,Mark Coates,Tongtong Cao,Xingyue Quan,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-WM: A hierarchical world model combining symbolic logic and visual perception for robust long-horizon robotic planning, mitigating error accumulation through synchronized logical and visual state prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for robotics either focus on video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional symbolic logic world models (planning domains) are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning but operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with a unified bilevel framework: high-level logical world model combined with low-level visual world model. The model jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions, integrating symbolic reasoning's robot-executable robustness with perceptual grounding from visual observations. Trained on a robotic dataset aligning robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate effectiveness and generality. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully bridges the gap between symbolic logic world models and visual perception, creating a unified framework that combines the strengths of both approaches for robust long-horizon robotic planning and control.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

### [3] [ExtremControl: Low-Latency Humanoid Teleoperation with Direct Extremity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11321)
*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, uses Cartesian-space mapping, and incorporates velocity feedforward control to achieve end-to-end latency as low as 50ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency (200ms+) due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid link targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level for responsiveness under rapidly changing control interfaces.

Result: The system achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms, substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit of prior work, and enables highly responsive behaviors like ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides a low-latency teleoperation framework that enables highly responsive humanoid behaviors previously impossible with existing approaches, opening possibilities for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MolmoSpaces is an open ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments and 130k+ annotated objects for large-scale robot policy benchmarking, featuring simulator-agnostic support and strong sim-to-real correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that are underrepresented in existing benchmarks. Physical evaluation alone cannot provide the scale and diversity needed to measure this level of generalization.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces ecosystem with over 230k diverse indoor environments (handcrafted households to procedurally generated multiroom houses) populated with 130k richly annotated object assets (48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps). Environments are simulator-agnostic (MuJoCo, Isaac, ManiSkill) and support full spectrum of embodied tasks. Also designed MolmoSpaces-Bench benchmark suite of 8 tasks.

Result: MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, ρ = 0.98). Experiments confirm newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in benchmarks and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research through its open-source assets and tooling, addressing the need for large-scale, diverse evaluation of robot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

### [5] [Human Preference Modeling Using Visual Motion Prediction Improves Robot Skill Learning from Egocentric Human Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11393)
*Mrinal Verghese,Christopher G. Atkeson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot learning approach that models human preferences from egocentric videos by predicting object motion and using this as a reward function, then optimizing robot behavior with modified SAC initialized with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on reward learning from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value as temporal distance to terminal states, make restrictive assumptions, and struggle with embodiment/environment transfer. There's a need for better methods that can learn directly from human videos and transfer effectively to robots.

Method: Learn human preferences by predicting motion of tracked points between subsequent images; define reward as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior. Use modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with only 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function from this reward and optimize policy that maximizes it, all executed directly on the robot.

Result: Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on real robots. The approach demonstrates capability for learning directly on real robots.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the embodiment gap by modeling human preferences through object motion prediction, enabling effective robot learning from egocentric human videos with minimal on-robot demonstrations.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

### [6] [EasyMimic: A Low-Cost Framework for Robot Imitation Learning from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11464)
*Tao Zhang,Song Xia,Ye Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EasyMimic is a low-cost imitation learning framework that enables robots to learn manipulation policies from human RGB video demonstrations, reducing the need for expensive robot data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot imitation learning is hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale real-world data, especially for low-cost home robots that need to be both user-friendly and affordable.

Method: Extracts 3D hand trajectories from human RGB videos, uses action alignment to map trajectories to gripper control space, employs hand visual augmentation to bridge human-to-robot domain gap, and applies co-training with fine-tuning on both processed human data and small robot data.

Result: Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate high performance across various manipulation tasks, significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: EasyMimic offers a practical, low-cost solution for bringing intelligent robots into homes by enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks from human video demonstrations.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

### [7] [Effective Task Planning with Missing Objects using Learning-Informed Object Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11468)
*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A planning framework that integrates learned object search policies (LIOS actions) into task planning to handle unknown object locations while maintaining compatibility with existing planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning assumes full environment knowledge and cannot handle unknown object locations, while standalone learning-driven search approaches are not easily integrated into full task planners that need to determine what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops a planning framework with novel model-based LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions, each being a policy to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic, using model-based calculations of expected cost to generate plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: Outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal preparation in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world environments, achieving effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers, enabling robust task planning in environments with unknown object locations.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

### [8] [HyperDet: 3D Object Detection with Hyper 4D Radar Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11554)
*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet is a detector-agnostic framework that refines sparse 4D radar point clouds through multi-frame aggregation, cross-sensor consensus validation, and foreground-focused diffusion with mixed supervision, enabling standard LiDAR detectors to work effectively with radar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar offers weather robustness and cost advantages over LiDAR, but radar-only 3D detection underperforms due to sparse, irregular point clouds corrupted by multipath noise, creating weak geometry that hinders existing LiDAR-oriented detectors.

Method: HyperDet constructs task-aware hyper 4D radar point clouds by: 1) aggregating returns from multiple surround-view radars over consecutive frames; 2) applying geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks; 3) integrating foreground-focused diffusion with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision during training, distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves detection performance over raw radar inputs when used with standard detectors like VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR-based systems.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar data to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, demonstrating that radar-only 3D detection can be improved through sophisticated point cloud preprocessing rather than detector redesign.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

### [9] [ReaDy-Go: Real-to-Sim Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting Simulation for Environment-Specific Visual Navigation with Moving Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11575)
*Seungyeon Yoo,Youngseok Jang,Dabin Kim,Youngsoo Han,Seungwoo Jung,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go is a real-to-sim pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios using 3D Gaussian Splatting to train robust visual navigation policies for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific deployment environments. Existing real-to-sim approaches using 3D Gaussian Splatting assume static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator integrating static scene GS with human animation module for animatable human GS avatars and plausible human motions from 2D trajectories; (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator, robot expert planner for dynamic GS representations, and human planner; (3) Policy learning using generated datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in presence of moving obstacles. Zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environment shows generalization potential.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go addresses limitations of prior real-to-sim approaches by enabling photorealistic dynamic scenario synthesis, resulting in more robust navigation policies for real-world dynamic environments with better sim-to-real transfer and obstacle handling capabilities.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of embodied navigation has been fragmented by task-specific architectures, lacking a unified approach that can handle multiple navigation tasks effectively.

Method: ABot-N0 uses a hierarchical "Brain-Action" architecture with an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning and a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for continuous trajectory generation.

Conclusion: ABot-N0 demonstrates that a unified VLA foundation model can achieve superior performance across multiple embodied navigation tasks compared to specialized architectures, representing a "Grand Unification" in the field.

Abstract: Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following.

ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models. Furthermore, our Agentic Navigation System integrates a planner with hierarchical topological memory, enabling robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.

*Yufeng Tian,Shuiqi Cheng,Tianming Wei,Tianxing Zhou,Yuanhang Zhang,Zixian Liu,Qianwei Han,Zhecheng Yuan,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTaS is a visuo-tactile fusion framework using Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning and CVAE to better leverage modality complementarity for robotic manipulation, especially in occluded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile approaches focus on feature alignment but use simple concatenation, failing to effectively handle occluded scenarios by neglecting modality complementarity and underutilizing alignment, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS framework incorporates Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and a CVAE module to exploit both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework for visuo-tactile fusion that better handles occluded scenarios by leveraging modality complementarity and improved alignment, advancing robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

### [12] [Human-Like Gaze Behavior in Social Robots: A Deep Learning Approach Integrating Human and Non-Human Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11648)
*Faezeh Vahedi,Morteza Memari,Ramtin Tabatabaei,Alireza Taheri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops neural network models (LSTM and Transformer) to predict human gaze behavior in social interactions, including responses to non-human stimuli, and deploys the system on a NAO robot to enhance social robot communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt their gaze behavior to human activities and respond to both human and non-human cues for effective communication. Current research lacks investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, which is crucial for seamless social interactions.

Method: Collected gaze data from 41 participants using VR glasses in simulated scenarios (3D animation and 360-degree real-world video). Preprocessed data trained LSTM and Transformer neural networks to predict gaze patterns. System deployed on NAO robot and evaluated by 275 participants via questionnaire.

Result: LSTM achieved 67.6% and Transformer 70.4% accuracy in animated scenarios; LSTM 72% and Transformer 71.6% in real-world scenarios. Models outperform existing approaches while uniquely considering non-human stimuli. Questionnaire results showed high user satisfaction during robot interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts, including responses to non-human stimuli, leading to more natural and effective human-robot interactions.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms presents challenges for MARL, particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training.

Result: Validated on custom multi-agent simulation platform, showing significant advantages over other advanced methods in Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attentive curriculum learning, demonstrating superior performance metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

TL;DR: HAIC is a unified framework for humanoid robots to robustly interact with diverse underactuated objects using only proprioceptive sensing, without external state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-Object Interaction (HOI) methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) from proprioceptive history, projects predictions onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a unified framework for robust humanoid-object interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation, enabling complex whole-body tasks with underactuated objects in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

*Sibaek Lee,Hyeonwoo Yu,Giseop Kim,Sunwook Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that uses implicit neural fields to encode language features, enabling efficient coarse-to-fine path planning with gradient-based optimization for precise goal-reaching in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps suffer from excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning, making them difficult to scale to large environments.

Method: LAMP learns a continuous, language-driven map using implicit neural fields to encode language features, combines this with a sparse graph for coarse path planning, then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. It employs Bayesian modeling of embedding uncertainty and graph sampling for scalability.

Result: LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy, as demonstrated in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor building experiments.

Conclusion: LAMP presents a scalable, memory-efficient approach to zero-shot navigation by using implicit neural language fields, enabling precise path generation through coarse-to-fine planning with gradient-based optimization, particularly effective for selecting goal regions not directly observed.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation tasks, which hinders real-world robot deployment. The limitation stems from relying solely on text instructions, which is inadequate for directing policy attention to target objects in complex, dynamic environments.

Method: The authors propose: 1) Leveraging bounding-box instructions to directly specify target objects; 2) Label-UMI, a handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline for efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels; 3) A semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets validate the approach's effectiveness, revealing a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. The proposed data collection strategy achieves 85% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that bounding-box instructions and data scaling laws can significantly improve generalization in semantic manipulation tasks, providing an effective data collection strategy and framework for real-world robot deployment. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that addresses key challenges of adaptation speed, stability, and generalization to diverse motion distributions.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions.

### [18] [Robot-DIFT: Distilling Diffusion Features for Geometrically Consistent Visuomotor Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11934)
*Yu Deng,Yufeng Jin,Xiaogang Jia,Jiahong Xue,Gerhard Neumann,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from frozen diffusion models into deterministic feature pyramids to overcome the structural mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and the geometric sensitivity needed for precise robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision encoders used in robot manipulation optimize for semantic invariance (good for classification) but create a "blind spot" for fine-grained control that requires geometric sensitivity to millimeter-level pose shifts. There's a structural mismatch between how models learn to see and how well they can learn to act.

Method: Proposes Robot-DIFT framework using Manifold Distillation to decouple geometric information from inference. Distills a frozen diffusion teacher (which inherently encodes geometric dependencies) into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), retaining rich geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift.

Result: Pretrained on large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the hypothesis that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not just data scale or policy capacity, but the structural mismatch between current visual backbones and physical requirements of closed-loop control. Robot-DIFT bridges this gap by leveraging diffusion models' geometric priors through distillation into stable, real-time feature representations.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate robot reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency through semantic guidance and exploration pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-in-the-Loop RL methods for robot manipulation suffer from scalability limitations due to 1:1 supervision ratios, operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: AGPS uses a multimodal agent as a semantic world model to provide intrinsic value priors, guiding exploration via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints using executable tools for exploration pruning.

Result: AGPS outperforms Human-in-the-Loop methods in sample efficiency across precision insertion and deformable object manipulation tasks, demonstrating automated supervision.

Conclusion: AGPS automates the robot learning supervision pipeline, enabling labor-free and scalable reinforcement learning for generalist manipulation skills.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

### [22] [When would Vision-Proprioception Policies Fail in Robotic Manipulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12032)
*Jingxian Lu,Wenke Xia,Yuxuan Wu,Zhiwu Lu,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-proprioception policies often fail to generalize due to proprioception dominating learning during motion transitions; GAP algorithm adaptively modulates proprioception gradients to enable balanced multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioception is critical for robotic control, and its collaboration with vision is expected to enhance manipulation policies. However, inconsistent observations exist regarding the generalization of vision-proprioception policies, particularly during motion-transition phases where target localization is required.

Method: Proposed Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates proprioception optimization. Uses proprioception to estimate probability of timesteps belonging to motion-transition phases, then applies fine-grained gradient magnitude reduction based on these probabilities to enable balanced vision-proprioception learning.

Result: GAP demonstrates applicability across simulated and real-world environments, one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatibility with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. Enables robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies by preventing proprioception from dominating learning during critical motion-transition phases.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into vision-proprioception policy development by addressing the optimization imbalance where proprioception naturally dominates during motion transitions, suppressing visual modality learning. GAP enables dynamic collaboration between modalities for improved generalization.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution, where conventional methods may fail.

Method: Uses weighted conformal prediction with learned state-control-dependent covariance to derive high-confidence model error bounds, integrated into SLS-based robust nonlinear MPC with constraint tightening via volume-optimized forward reachable sets.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, with empirical validation on nonlinear systems (4D car and 12D quadcopter) showing improved safety and robustness compared to baselines, especially out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables robust out-of-distribution planning with safety guarantees by combining conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification with system level synthesis for robust control synthesis.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollouts are expensive to collect, and existing world models lack physical fidelity for policy improvement due to limited demonstration datasets and poor modeling of contact-rich manipulation details.

Method: Proposes an iterative improvement algorithm: real-world rollout data improves world model fidelity, which then generates supplemental synthetic data for VLA model improvement.

Result: Achieves 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of world models using real-world data enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, addressing physical fidelity limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification.

Conclusion: Adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

*David Russell,Zisong Xu,Maximo A. Roa,Mehmet Dogar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Contact-aware bin-packing approach that uses purposeful interactions with existing items to create space for new placements in partially filled containers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation requires efficient bin-packing, but existing methods focus on empty containers and collision avoidance. Real-world scenarios involve partially filled containers with suboptimal arrangements due to transportation, requiring strategies that can work with existing items rather than just avoiding them.

Method: Contact-aware packing approach using: 1) contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within model predictive controller, 2) physics-aware perception system for pose estimation during occlusions, and 3) method for suggesting physically-feasible placement locations.

Result: The approach enables successful placement of new items into partially filled containers by exploiting purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space, overcoming limitations of collision-free strategies.

Conclusion: Contact-aware manipulation strategies that purposefully interact with existing items are essential for practical warehouse bin-packing operations, enabling more flexible and robust automation in real-world scenarios with partially filled containers.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

*Itamar Mishani,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multi-Graph Search (MGS) is a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical search to multiple graphs, enabling efficient high-dimensional planning with predictable motions and reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning algorithms for high-dimensional robotic systems often generate unpredictable, inconsistent motions or require excessive computational resources and memory, limiting real-time operation and reliable deployment.

Method: MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as search progresses.

Result: MGS is proven to be complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirical demonstrations show effectiveness on manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks with available benchmarks and code.

Conclusion: MGS provides an efficient motion planning solution for high-dimensional robotic systems that addresses the limitations of existing approaches while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

*Wancai Zheng,Hao Chen,Xianlong Lu,Linlin Ou,Xinyi Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3DGSNav is a zero-shot object navigation framework that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for vision-language models, enabling enhanced spatial reasoning through active perception and structured visual prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods rely on scene abstractions (semantic maps or textual representations) that constrain high-level decision making by the accuracy of low-level perception. There's a need for a framework that better integrates spatial reasoning with visual-language understanding.

Method: The framework incrementally constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation of the environment through active perception, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. It uses structured visual prompts combined with Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve VLM reasoning, with real-time object detection filtering potential targets and VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav successfully integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for VLMs, enhancing spatial reasoning capabilities for zero-shot object navigation and achieving strong performance in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced locomotion using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient motions of slender bodies like snakes and spermatozoa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric framework for modeling optimal locomotion of slender bodies where motion is determined by shape changes, accounting for both environmental drag and internal metabolic/actuator energy dissipation.

Method: Formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics, with continuous model and consistent discretization for numerical computation of optimal deformation gaits under various boundary conditions.

Result: Numerically computed optimal gaits qualitatively match observed biological motions (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results for low-dimensional systems like Purcell's swimmers, while providing new insights into generalized locomotion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The geometric model successfully captures overall locomotion efficiency by accounting for both external and internal energy dissipation, offering a flexible framework that matches biological observations and enables new insights into optimal locomotion mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that learns dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting from heterogeneous embodied data using structured DINO latent space and multi-modal diffusion transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models rely on behavior cloning which discards transferable dynamics knowledge from heterogeneous embodied data. Unified World Model formulations struggle to scale due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: Joint learning of dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting with distinct roles for varying data quality. Uses structured DINO latent space for scalable dynamics learning, avoiding redundant pixel-space modeling. Employs multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams for stable 1B-parameter training.

Result: Outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. Enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% improvement by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories typically discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates scalable robot foundation modeling through universal embodied data ingestion with structured latent representations and multi-modal transformer architecture, enabling effective utilization of heterogeneous data quality.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

*Zhihong Liu,Yang Li,Rengming Huang,Cewu Lu,Panpan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AHAT is a household task planning system that uses an LLM to map ambiguous instructions and scene graphs into PDDL subgoals, then performs symbolic reasoning for optimal long-horizon planning, enhanced by TGPO reinforcement learning for better intention decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability in large household environments, degrading with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. There's a need for systems that can handle brief human instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Method: AHAT uses an LLM trained to convert task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded PDDL subgoals, followed by symbolic reasoning for optimal planning. TGPO (novel RL algorithm) integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into GRPO to enhance complex intention decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly excelling in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Conclusion: AHAT demonstrates effective integration of LLMs with symbolic reasoning for scalable household task planning, with TGPO enhancing the model's ability to handle ambiguous human instructions and complex intention decomposition in large environments.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoVer introduces test-time verification with contrastive learning to reduce intention-action gaps in Vision-Language-Action models, achieving significant performance gains through hierarchical verification and boot-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Vision-Language-Action models, generated actions often misalign with natural language instructions. The paper aims to shrink this "intention-action gap" through test-time verification approaches.

Method: Proposes CoVer, a contrastive verifier for VLA alignment, with test-time scaling laws showing joint scaling of rephrased instructions and generated actions increases sample diversity. Introduces "boot-time compute" and hierarchical verification pipeline that precomputes diverse instruction rephrasings, generates multiple action candidates, and uses verifier to select optimal prompts and action chunks.

Result: 22% in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution gains on SIMPLER benchmark compared to scaling policy pre-training; additional 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On PolaRiS benchmark: 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with CoVer effectively reduces intention-action gaps in VLA models, demonstrating that verification approaches outperform scaling policy pre-training alone, with architecture scaling gracefully with computational resources and data.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing ML use in sensitive domains requires transparency, but current XAI methods demand technical expertise, creating a gap in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI.

Method: Developed human-centered XAI module in DashAI integrating PDP, PFI, and KernelSHAP for tabular classification; conducted user study with 20 participants (novices and experts) evaluating usability and explanation impact.

Result: High task success (≥80%), novices rated explanations as useful/accurate/trustworthy (ESS α=0.74), experts were critical of sufficiency/completeness, explanations improved perceived predictability/confidence (TiA α=0.60), novices showed higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: XAI in no-code ML faces challenge of making explanations accessible to novices while sufficiently detailed for experts; integrated module successfully addresses this balance in DashAI platform.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

TL;DR: Latent Generative Solvers (LGS) is a two-stage framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that maps diverse PDE states to a shared latent space via VAE, then learns probabilistic latent dynamics with Transformer trained by flow matching, achieving 70× lower FLOPs than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that can handle long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems while being computationally efficient and reliable for scientific workflows.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) pretrained VAE maps diverse PDE states into shared latent physics space, (2) Transformer learns probabilistic latent dynamics via flow matching with uncertainty knob mechanism for correcting off-manifold drift and flow forcing for context alignment.

Result: Pretrained on ~2.5M trajectories across 12 PDE families at 128² resolution; matches deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons; achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines; shows efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows through latent space learning and efficient architectural design.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

TL;DR: DecisionDB formalizes decision-valued maps that track how computational outcomes vary with data representations, enabling deterministic replay and audit of representation-dependent decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can lead to different computational outcomes, creating a need to systematically track which representations preserve results versus change them, and to enable reliable auditing of these representation-dependent decisions.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate each representation in a family with its discrete outcome; implements DecisionDB infrastructure that logs, replays, and audits these relationships using content-derived identifiers and write-once artifact storage.

Result: Enables deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers from stored artifacts with all identifying fields matching persisted values; partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for treating decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition, offering systematic approach to managing representation-dependent computational outcomes through formalized tracking and auditing infrastructure.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI governance frameworks (like NIST AI RMF) provide principles but lack implementable architectures for multi-agent, AI-enabled cyber defense in enterprise AI estates that span models, agents, data pipelines, and infrastructure.

Method: Proposes PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: a multi-agent reference architecture with 12-domain taxonomy, bounded agent families, shared context envelopes, structured output contracts, and formal modeling of agents and ecosystem invariants.

Result: Demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrates application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments, providing traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees.

Conclusion: PBSAI offers a structured, evidence-centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation of secure AI governance in enterprise and hyperscale environments.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

TL;DR: Systematic review critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, revealing how consensus-seeking annotation practices erase human disagreement as sociotechnical signal, proposing pluralistic annotation infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the positivistic fallacy in machine learning that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than vital sociotechnical signal, investigating how current annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that erases cultural pluralism and imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks.

Method: Systematic literature review (2020-2025) across seven premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS) using tiered keyword filtration from 30,897 records to 3,042 for manual screening, resulting in 346 papers for qualitative synthesis via reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Reveals systemic failures in positional legibility and anchoring bias from model-mediated annotations; demonstrates geographic hegemony imposing Western norms via precarious data workers' performative alignment; critiques "noisy sensor" fallacy that misdiagnoses cultural pluralism as random error.

Conclusion: Proposes reclaiming disagreement as high-fidelity signal for culturally competent models and advocates for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that map diversity of human experience rather than seeking singular "right" answers.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

TL;DR: BLPO: A bi-level prompt optimization framework for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of AI-generated images that overcomes context window limitations by converting images to textual representations while preserving visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI-generated content evaluation, but aligning them with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning improves alignment, it's costly and inflexible. Auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing methods focus on text-only evaluations and are underexplored in multimodal settings, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images where context window constraints limit visual example processing.

Method: Proposes BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. The approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets, overcoming the bottleneck of multimodal models' limited ability to process visual examples due to context window constraints.

Result: Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved alignment with human judgments for AI-generated image evaluation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: BLPO provides an effective solution for auto prompt optimization in multimodal LLM-as-a-judge settings, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images, by addressing the key bottleneck of context window limitations through bi-level optimization of judge and I2T prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench is a framework for evaluating LLM-based agent robustness under realistic noisy environments, categorizing noise into user-noise and tool-noise, and revealing performance sensitivity to environmental perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a performance gap between LLM-based agents' benchmark performance and real-world deployment due to idealized training/evaluation paradigms that overlook real-world stochasticity and noise. Current approaches fail to account for inherent uncertainties in real-world interactions.

Method: 1) Conducted in-depth analysis of real-world biases and uncertainties, categorizing environmental noise into user-noise and tool-noise. 2) Developed automated pipeline to inject controllable noise into existing agent benchmarks while preserving task solvability. 3) Performed extensive evaluations across diverse models with various architectures and parameter scales.

Result: Revealed consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations. Performance degradation observed when moving from idealized benchmarks to noisy real-world conditions.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench provides a systematic framework for evaluating agent robustness under noisy environments, bridging the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment by accounting for realistic environmental uncertainties.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that balances proactive reasoning with user engagement by combining behavior enhancement for better information gathering and behavior regularization to suppress inefficient interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt to user intentions while excessive human feedback reduces user satisfaction.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (enriching proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (suppressing inefficient/redundant interactions and aligning agent behavior with user expectations).

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite and achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios by addressing the trade-off between task performance and user engagement.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench: A benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to replicate scientific research, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by including both replicable and non-replicable claims and assessing the full replication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI assessment of scientific papers focus primarily on computational reproduction with code/data access, failing to capture real-world challenges like inconsistent data availability for replication, lack of ground-truth diversity (only reproducible papers), and evaluation of outcomes rather than the replication process.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark with human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims from social/behavioral sciences. Evaluates AI agents across three stages: (1) extraction/retrieval of replication data, (2) design/execution of computational experiments, and (3) interpretation of results. Also develops ReplicatorAgent framework with tools like web search and sandboxed environment interaction.

Result: Evaluation of ReplicatorAgent across four LLMs shows current agents can effectively design/execute computational experiments but struggle with retrieving necessary resources (e.g., new data) for replication. Different programming languages and code access levels were also tested.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench addresses critical gaps in evaluating AI research replication capabilities by including non-replicable claims and assessing the full replication process. Current LLM agents show limitations in resource retrieval despite strong computational experiment design abilities, highlighting areas for improvement in AI-assisted scientific replication.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations, using object-level masking to force interaction reasoning and induce causal inductive bias, improving counterfactual reasoning and planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric representations alone are insufficient for capturing interaction-dependent dynamics in world models; robust relational understanding is needed for prediction, reasoning, and control.

Method: C-JEPA applies object-level masking to object-centric representations, requiring an object's state to be inferred from other objects, which induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions.

Result: C-JEPA achieves ~20% absolute improvement in counterfactual reasoning on visual question answering and enables substantially more efficient planning (using only 1% of latent input features) while maintaining comparable performance to patch-based world models on agent control tasks.

Conclusion: Object-level masking in object-centric world models induces causal inductive bias via latent interventions, making interaction reasoning essential and leading to improved relational understanding for prediction, reasoning, and control.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 models that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity degradation using forward-pass statistics instead of backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but creates inference bottlenecks during autoregressive generation due to bandwidth saturation. Standard pruning methods are inadequate: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods are too computationally expensive.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. It jointly measures controllability and observability to identify which state dimensions to prune, rivaling gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation.

Result: On models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, GHOST achieves a 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2, significantly reducing inference overhead while maintaining model fidelity.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an efficient structured pruning framework that addresses Mamba2's inference bottlenecks by leveraging forward-pass statistics to approximate control-theoretic balanced truncation, achieving substantial state dimension reduction with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-using interactions that detects critical failure episodes by combining content-aware surprisal, situational-awareness signals, repetition patterns, and tool-grounded coherence gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals in multi-turn tool-using interactions, where failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on the τ²-bench for predicting task failure and selective task execution, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: TRACER effectively addresses the limitations of single-shot uncertainty metrics by providing a trajectory-level approach that captures critical failure episodes in multi-turn tool-using interactions, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

*Chengrui Qu,Christopher Yeh,Kishan Panaganti,Eric Mazumdar,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrIGM introduces distributionally robust IGM principle for MARL to handle environmental uncertainties, enabling robust value-factorization methods that maintain decentralized execution while providing provable robustness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL methods using centralized training with decentralized execution are unreliable in real-world settings due to environmental uncertainties from sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise.

Method: Proposes Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM) principle requiring agents' robust greedy actions to align with robust team-optimal joint action. Derives robust individual action values compatible with decentralized execution, and creates DrIGM-compliant variants of existing value-factorization architectures (VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that train on robust Q-targets while preserving scalability.

Result: Methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and StarCraft game environment, with provable robustness guarantees for the whole system.

Conclusion: DrIGM provides a principled approach to robust MARL that maintains decentralized execution while addressing environmental uncertainties, with seamless integration into existing codebases and improved real-world reliability.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

TL;DR: AT-RL selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual anchor tokens via graph clustering, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead by focusing credit assignment on crucial multimodal grounding points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RLVR for MLLMs, the mechanism of visual evidence integration during reasoning remains poorly understood, particularly how attention connectivity between modalities influences reasoning quality.

Method: Analyzed cross-modal attention connectivity, identified high-connectivity anchor tokens (~15%), and developed Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) - a lightweight framework using graph-based clustering of attention topology to selectively reinforce these visual anchors.

Result: AT-RL with only 1.2% overhead enables 32B model to surpass 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains across STEM, video, and general tasks. Training on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality in multimodal RL depends not on token quantity but on fidelity of cross-modal anchoring; effective RLVR requires precise credit assignment to visual anchor tokens rather than uniform reinforcement.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

### [50] [AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510)
*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first comprehensive benchmark for measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, revealing that internal channels (inter-agent messages) leak significantly more sensitive data than output channels, with output-only audits missing 41.7% of violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLMs only measure output leakage, but multi-agent systems create additional privacy risks through internal channels like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments that are never inspected in output-only audits.

Method: Developed AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, featuring a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Tested GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces to measure leakage across different channels (C1: output, C2: inter-agent messages, C5: other internal channels).

Result: Multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9%. Inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8% compared to 27.2% on output channel (C1), meaning output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet had lowest leakage rates (3.3% external, 28.1% internal). Pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently across all models and domains.

Conclusion: Inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems, requiring coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and privacy controls on inter-agent communication, as current output-only audits are insufficient for measuring true privacy risks.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches focus on learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations but neglect continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves, which is crucial for sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments.

Method: A human-inspired continuous learning framework unifying reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects, supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures, and introduces hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanisms.

Result: Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%. The system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables AI systems to learn and optimize their internal reasoning processes alongside task execution, representing a significant advancement toward more adaptive and efficient AI that can continuously improve its cognitive architecture.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers requiring dual expertise in statistics and computer science, plus manual algorithm selection, data quality handling, and complex result interpretation.

Method: Integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate the entire causal inference pipeline from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction.

Conclusion: CausalAgent represents a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm that explicitly models the analysis workflow, making causal inference more accessible without sacrificing methodological rigor.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

*Hanbing Liu,Chunhao Tian,Nan An,Ziyuan Wang,Pinyan Lu,Changyuan Yu,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: INTENT is an inference-time planning framework for budget-constrained tool-augmented LLM agents that uses intention-aware hierarchical world modeling to anticipate tool usage and costs, enabling strict budget adherence while improving task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need to solve multi-step tasks using external tools under strict monetary budgets, but direct planning is intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high outcome variance, and prohibitive exploration costs in priced, stochastic tool execution environments.

Method: INTENT: inference-time planning framework with intention-aware hierarchical world model that anticipates future tool usage and risk-calibrated costs to guide online decisions in budget-constrained tool-augmented agent settings.

Result: INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines on cost-augmented StableToolBench, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts like tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT provides an effective solution for budget-constrained tool-augmented agents by combining inference-time planning with intention-aware hierarchical modeling to handle the challenges of priced, stochastic tool execution while maintaining strict budget adherence.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative models for semantic-statistical population synthesis, using persona representations from survey data as semantic conditioning while enforcing marginal alignment with target population statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis methods focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints but lack semantic conditioning to capture abstract behavioral patterns implicit in survey data, creating a gap in semantic-aware population generation.

Method: Proposes SemaPop framework that derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records using LLMs, incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals, and uses marginal regularization to enforce alignment with target population marginals. Instantiated with WGAN-GP backbone (SemaPop-GAN).

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies confirm contributions of semantic persona conditioning and architectural choices.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion, providing a modular foundation for generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

TL;DR: ARC learns hierarchical RL policies to dynamically configure LLM agents per query, outperforming fixed templates with 25% higher accuracy and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics for configuration, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute since the same configuration is applied to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts).

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating that dynamic configuration via learned policies significantly improves both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

### [56] [The Five Ws of Multi-Agent Communication: Who Talks to Whom, When, What, and Why -- A Survey from MARL to Emergent Language and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11583)
*Jingdi Chen,Hanqing Yang,Zongjun Liu,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of multi-agent communication evolution across MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM-based systems using the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, why, how).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication is essential for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic, partially observable environments to reduce uncertainty. Existing research is fragmented across different paradigms, requiring a unified framework to connect ideas and identify trade-offs.

Method: Survey approach using the Five Ws framework (who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, why communication is beneficial) to analyze three major paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Emergent Language (EL), and LLM-based systems.

Result: Traces evolution from early MARL with hand-designed/implicit protocols to end-to-end learned communication, then to EL for structured/symbolic communication, and finally to LLMs with natural language priors. Identifies trade-offs: MARL protocols are task-specific and hard to interpret, EL struggles with grounding/generalization/scalability, LLMs offer open-ended reasoning but face different challenges.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration. The Five Ws framework provides a clean way to connect research threads and distill practical design patterns while highlighting open challenges.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces a modality-aware post-training ecosystem for multimodal RL that addresses the problem of treating all input signals as equally relevant, improving training efficiency and robustness to real-world signal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input modalities (text, audio, video) as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind approach inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE comprises three components: (1) MAPLE-bench - first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO - modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. Systematic analysis establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design.

Conclusion: MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training, addressing the critical need for modality-aware training that adapts to real-world signal availability variations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework enabling LLMs to perform omics-native reasoning by directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and bioinformatics tools, converting core analyses into stepwise reasoning problems with iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language models to perform interpretable, auditable single-cell analyses by grounding them directly in raw omics data rather than relying on pre-processed or summarized information, allowing for transparent reasoning about biological processes.

Method: scPilot converts core single-cell analyses (cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, transcription-factor targeting) into step-by-step reasoning problems that LLMs must solve, justify, and revise with new evidence. It enables LLMs to directly inspect single-cell RNA-seq data and access on-demand bioinformatics tools while conversing in natural language.

Result: Experiments show iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (using o1 model) and reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% (using Gemini-2.5-Pro) compared to one-shot prompting. The framework generates transparent reasoning traces that explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic.

Conclusion: By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses, advancing the field toward more transparent and reliable computational biology workflows.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

### [59] [When Agents Disagree With Themselves: Measuring Behavioral Consistency in LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11619)
*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents exhibit significant behavioral inconsistency across repeated runs on identical tasks, with this variance strongly predicting task failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when executing the same task multiple times, and to understand the relationship between behavioral consistency and task success.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, analyzing variance in action sequences and its correlation with accuracy.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs; tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while inconsistent tasks (≥6 unique paths) achieve only 25-60% accuracy; 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: Behavioral inconsistency in LLM agents strongly predicts failure, with early decisions (particularly the first search query) being critical divergence points, suggesting that monitoring consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

*Yipeng Huang,Dejun Xu,Zexin Lin,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NMIPS is a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver that discovers analytical solutions for PDE families using multifactorial optimization and affine transfer of learned mathematical structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods require independent solving of each PDE instance in a family, incurring massive computational costs. Machine learning PDE solvers offer speed but lack interpretability due to their black-box nature and inability to provide analytical expressions essential for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Employs affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among related PDEs, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases show promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by combining computational efficiency with interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through neuro-assisted symbolic solving and structure transfer.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

TL;DR: MathSpatial is a unified framework for evaluating and improving mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing their poor performance on spatial reasoning tasks compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on perception tasks but show significant weakness in mathematical spatial reasoning (parsing and manipulating 2D/3D relations), with most models failing to reach 60% accuracy on tasks where humans achieve over 95%.

Method: MathSpatial framework includes three components: (1) MathSpatial-Bench - a 2K problem benchmark across 3 categories and 11 subtypes designed to isolate reasoning from perception; (2) MathSpatial-Corpus - an 8K problem training dataset with verified solutions; (3) MathSpatial-SRT - a structured reasoning trace method modeling reasoning as three atomic operations: Correlate, Constrain, and Infer.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing token usage by 25%. The framework provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning for precise measurement of spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial identifies spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness in current MLLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for both evaluation and improvement, enabling better understanding and enhancement of mathematical spatial reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm addressing RL limitations for medical QA by decomposing alignment into four categories with closed-loop supervision and unified optimization to handle heterogeneous reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL paradigms (RLHF and RL from verifiable rewards) are mismatched for medical QA due to expensive preference annotations, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and inability to handle complex clinical contexts while simultaneously optimizing correctness, safety, and compliance.

Method: Constructs a multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix decomposing objectives into four categories (fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, format specifications) with closed-loop supervision. Implements unified optimization using Reference-Frozen Normalization for scale alignment and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm that addresses fundamental limitations of existing RL approaches for medical QA through fine-grained supervision and unified optimization, enabling effective alignment in high-stakes medical contexts.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

*E Fan,Lisong Shi,Zhengtong Li,Chih-yung Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic agentic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to address the semantic-physical disconnect in LLM-based autonomous CFD agents, achieving 96% relative improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD suffer from probabilistic nature that cannot enforce strict conservation laws and numerical stability, leading to physically invalid configurations due to semantic-physical disconnect and context poisoning in RAG systems.

Method: PhyNiKCE employs a neurosymbolic architecture with a Symbolic Knowledge Engine treating simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, using a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions to rigidly enforce physical constraints.

Result: 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in OpenFOAM experiments on practical CFD tasks, 59% reduction in autonomous self-correction loops, and 17% lower LLM token consumption by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in autonomous CFD agents, providing a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy AI in broader industrial automation beyond CFD.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BHI is a data-driven framework for auditing LLM benchmarks across three axes: discrimination, anti-saturation, and impact, using 106 benchmarks from 91 models to quantify benchmark health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM benchmarks are becoming unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, creating uncertainty about trustworthy evaluation results in the community.

Method: Introduces Benchmark Health Index (BHI) with three orthogonal axes: Capability Discrimination (separates model performance beyond noise), Anti-Saturation (estimates headroom before ceiling effects), and Impact (quantifies adoption breadth and practice-shaping power). Analyzes 106 validated benchmarks from technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025.

Result: Systematically characterizes the evaluation landscape and provides the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, enabling principled benchmark selection and dynamic lifecycle management.

Conclusion: BHI addresses benchmark reliability issues by providing a data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets, offering a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic management of next-generation evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [65] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Rung Collapse as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models fail to distinguish association from intervention, leading to Aleatoric Entrenchment where correct outcomes reinforce flawed causal reasoning. It proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) as a belief revision objective with theoretical guarantees and demonstrates its effectiveness in recovering entrenched errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift. This pathology stems from autoregressive training's inability to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), leading to models that are "right for the wrong reasons" and become entrenched in flawed causal reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. It introduces a three-layer architecture with: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem linking actions to do-operations, (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, and (3) a failure mode taxonomy with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs show Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2). Steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction. Targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails, with proven asymptotic recovery of true interventional distribution and finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: Rung Collapse represents a fundamental limitation in current autoregressive training that prevents proper causal reasoning. The proposed ERM framework with its theoretical grounding and practical implementation effectively addresses Aleatoric Entrenchment, enabling models to distinguish association from intervention and recover from flawed causal reasoning even when achieving correct outcomes.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable prioritized planning method for large UAV fleets that handles temporal NFZs, heterogeneous vehicles, and delivery deadlines through incremental conflict resolution and geometric pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world UTM with temporal NFZs, heterogeneous UAV profiles, and strict delivery deadlines in dynamic shared airspace.

Method: DTAPP-IICR uses prioritized planning based on urgency, computes trajectories with SFIPP-ST (4D planner for heterogeneous UAVs with temporal NFZs), and performs iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by geometric conflict graph with directional pruning.

Result: Achieves near-100% success with up to 1,000 UAVs, 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search, and scales successfully in realistic city-scale operations.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR provides a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace where other priority-based methods fail.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline to address structural blindness in MLLMs by converting CAD diagrams into property graphs for engineering compliance checks, achieving significant accuracy improvements over pixel-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. The benchmark and implementation are released publicly.

Conclusion: Pixel-based methods are systemically inadequate for engineering tasks requiring structural reasoning, and structure-aware representations like V2G provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit chain-of-thought and latent reasoning based on model confidence to improve reasoning efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in latent reasoning approaches where effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis reveals that incorrect reasoning trajectories contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones, and soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives can introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning.

Method: ThinkRouter is an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism that routes thinking to discrete token space (explicit CoT) when model confidence is low, and to latent space (latent reasoning) otherwise. This dynamic switching avoids high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories and reduces noise propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks show ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines, achieving average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1 while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. It effectively calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter demonstrates that confidence-aware routing between explicit and latent reasoning spaces can significantly improve reasoning efficiency and accuracy by avoiding high confidence in unreliable trajectories and reducing noise propagation, with the mechanism accelerating end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses sparse complementary fusion with reverse KL divergence to reduce functional interference and improve merging stability compared to existing parameter-space heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: SCF-RKL explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure functional divergence between models and selectively incorporate complementary parameters with a mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design.

Result: SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods across 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety, while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability across various model scales and architectures.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL provides an effective model merging framework that addresses interference issues through sparse complementary fusion with reverse KL divergence, enabling better integration of specialized models without costly retraining.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

*Thomas Jiralerspong,Trenton Bricken*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) for cross-architecture model diffing, enabling unsupervised identification of safety-critical behaviors like political alignment, exceptionalism, and copyright refusal mechanisms in different LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model diffing methods are limited to comparing base models with their finetunes, but new LLM releases often involve novel architectures. Cross-architecture methods are needed to make model diffing widely applicable for identifying safety-critical behaviors across different model families.

Method: The authors adapt crosscoders for cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. This enables unsupervised feature discovery across different model architectures.

Result: Using DFCs, the authors identified: Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-architecture model diffing.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing with DFCs is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, establishing it as a valuable tool for safety analysis across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for Text-to-Graph-Query-Language systems, featuring 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains with multi-GQL support and a novel evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-GQL systems lack high-quality benchmark datasets with sufficient domain coverage, supported graph query languages, and comprehensive evaluation methods, hindering systematic advancement of the field.

Method: Developed Text2GQL-Bench with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets across different domains, question abstraction levels, and graph query languages using heterogeneous resources. Introduced a multi-faceted evaluation method assessing grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy.

Result: Evaluation reveals a significant dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: strong LLMs achieve only ≤4% execution accuracy zero-shot, but 3-shot prompting boosts to ~50% (though grammatical validity remains <70%). A fine-tuned 8B model reaches 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity, showing most performance gains come from sufficient ISO-GQL exposure.

Conclusion: Text2GQL-Bench addresses critical limitations in Text-to-GQL benchmarking, enabling systematic comparison across languages and domains. The benchmark reveals substantial challenges in ISO-GQL generation that can be mitigated through example exposure and fine-tuning, providing a foundation for advancing LLM-based graph query systems.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is the first incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously manages the incident lifecycle through detection, containment, recovery, and rule synthesis to prevent future incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus only on preventing failures in advance, lacking capabilities to respond to, contain, or recover from incidents after they inevitably occur.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for managing incident response lifecycle, integrated into agent execution loop to: (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in environment state and context, (2) guide agents to execute containment/recovery actions via tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains, with moderate overhead and timeliness.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, moving beyond prevention-only approaches to comprehensive lifecycle management.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) is a training-time approach that uses lightweight tree-style search to generate higher-quality rollouts for multi-turn reinforcement learning agents, improving performance and stability without changing the optimization objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL faces challenges with sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments, where naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and cause mode collapse. Existing methods struggle with generating high-quality training rollouts in these settings.

Method: TSR repurposes test-time scaling ideas for training-time rollout generation. It performs lightweight tree-style search (best-of-N, beam, shallow lookahead) to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. The approach is optimizer-agnostic and leaves the underlying RL objective unchanged.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks when paired with PPO and GRPO, with only a one-time increase in training compute.

Conclusion: By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning that complements existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style methods.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing evaluation metrics, outperforming traditional thresholding methods for species distribution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binarization methods for converting probabilistic SDM predictions to binary presence-absence maps are heuristic and distort species prevalence and community composition estimates, especially under class imbalance and rarity.

Method: MaxExp framework selects species assemblages by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics without calibration data; Set Size Expectation (SSE) method predicts assemblages based on expected species richness as a computationally efficient alternative.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across three case studies with diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, particularly under strong class imbalance and high rarity; SSE offers simpler competitive performance.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization that address limitations of heuristic thresholding methods and improve ecological inference and conservation planning.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment, improving conversion metrics while maintaining policy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial advertising systems use a two-stage paradigm (generation then alignment) that leads to misaligned optimization objectives, low funnel efficiency, and limits global optimality. The separation between text generation and downstream metric alignment creates inefficiencies.

Method: RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. It uses reinforcement learning with multi-dimensional rewards that combine conversion-oriented metrics and compliance constraints, enabling end-to-end optimization of ad text generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets show RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) while maintaining strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework successfully addresses the limitations of decoupled systems by unifying generation and objective alignment, demonstrating robustness and real-world effectiveness in improving advertiser value while ensuring policy compliance.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Method: Execute-Summarize (ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on FlowBench through extensive experiments, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Conclusion: The ES framework offers an effective solution for accurately translating LLM task solutions into structured workflows by decoupling execution from workflow construction, demonstrating superior performance over integrated approaches.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems using specialized agents coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, achieving high throughput and significant cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, with limitations in procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent system with Orchestrating Agent coordinating specialized agents: Solution Agent for problem solving, Illustration Agent for visualization codes, and Narration Agent for instructional scripts. Uses quality gates, iterative critique mechanisms, semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks to generate structured executable video scripts compiled into synchronized visuals and narration.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding one million videos per day, over 95% cost reduction compared to industry-standard approaches, while maintaining high acceptance rate through automated end-to-end production without manual editing.

Conclusion: LAVES successfully addresses limitations of prior video generation approaches by decomposing educational video creation into specialized tasks with rigorous quality control, enabling scalable, cost-effective production of logically rigorous instructional content.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-$k$NN Distance is a black-box detection method that identifies RLVR-trained examples by measuring reduced diversity in model outputs, outperforming existing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training creates benchmark contamination concerns because it fine-tunes models using reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods ineffective. There's a need for reliable detection methods that don't require access to reference models or token probabilities.

Method: The paper introduces Min-$k$NN Distance, a black-box detector that quantifies output diversity collapse in RLVR-trained models. For a given prompt, it samples multiple completions and computes the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. This method requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities.

Result: Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Conclusion: RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature of reduced output diversity for training prompts, which can be effectively detected using the proposed Min-$k$NN Distance method without requiring model internals or token probabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

### [79] [Hi-SAM: A Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal Framework for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11799)
*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM is a hierarchical structure-aware multi-modal recommendation framework that addresses tokenization redundancy and architecture-data mismatch through disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical memory-anchor transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal recommendation approaches using semantic IDs face two key challenges: (1) suboptimal tokenization where existing methods lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchical structure of user interactions, items, and tokens.

Method: Hi-SAM introduces two key designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via coarse-to-fine strategy with shared codebooks for consensus and modality-specific codebooks for nuances, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory while retaining details for current items.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing semantic ID-based multi-modal recommendation by introducing hierarchical structure awareness and disentangled tokenization, leading to significant performance improvements in both offline experiments and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

*Lianjun Wu,Shengchen Zhu,Yuxuan Liu,Liuyu Kai,Xiaoduan Feng,Duomin Wang,Wenshuo Liu,Jingxuan Zhang,Kelvin Li,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves weather forecasting by addressing limited diffusability in latent diffusion models through 3D-MAE encoding and variable-aware spectral regularization, achieving superior short-term performance to ENS while maintaining comparable long-term accuracy with efficient parallel generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models struggle with limited diffusability in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to lack of meteorological foundation models and inappropriate spectral regularization that doesn't account for inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate weather data.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning for the diffusion model, and 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects spectral regularization thresholds based on each variable's spectral energy distribution.

Result: PuYun-LDM enhances latent diffusability, achieves superior performance to ENS (ensemble forecasting) at short lead times while remaining comparable at longer horizons, generates 15-day global forecasts with 6-hour temporal resolution in 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, and enables efficient parallel ensemble production.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the diffusability limitations in weather forecasting LDMs by incorporating weather-specific conditioning and variable-aware spectral regularization, enabling efficient high-resolution ensemble forecasting with competitive performance across different lead times.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for efficient LLM inference that reuses internal hidden states for length prediction, featuring Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) for static prediction and Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) for stochastic generation, achieving 29.16% MAE reduction and significant throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed sequence length distributions in LLM serving and RL sampling cause computational waste from excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods using auxiliary models for static length prediction have high overhead, poor generalization, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: A lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation.

Result: EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ForeLen benchmark, reducing MAE by 29.16% over best baseline. Integration with length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. ForeLen benchmark released with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by addressing computational waste from padding through lightweight, accurate length prediction that handles both static and stochastic generation scenarios.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

*Jialin Wu,Wei Shi,Han Shen,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Zhicong Huang,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS is a training-free framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention at specific network depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination due to visual features becoming intertwined with pretrained textual representations in deeper network layers, suppressing visual information.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection to extract pure visual information vectors and performs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where visual suppression occurs, based on latent space geometry analysis.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving general reasoning capabilities, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The training-free REVIS framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through targeted intervention in latent space geometry.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

*Yordan Yordanov,Matteo Forasassi,Bayar Menzat,Ruizhi Wang,Chang Qi,Markus Kaltenberger,Amine M'Charrak,Tommaso Salvatori,Thomas Lukasiewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoT is a novel autoregressive language model architecture using prototype vectors instead of self-attention, offering linear sequence-length scaling, interpretable concept learning, and comparable performance to state-of-the-art transformers while enabling transparent reasoning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models lack transparency in their reasoning processes, which undermines trust and introduces risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for models that maintain high performance while being interpretable by design.

Method: ProtoT replaces standard self-attention with prototype-based architecture using parameter vectors. It employs two-way communication between input sequences and prototypes, allowing prototypes to automatically learn nameable concepts during training. The design creates communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales.

Result: ProtoT achieves linear scalability with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs well on text generation and GLUE tasks, scales effectively with model/data size, and shows robustness to input perturbations comparable to baselines. Prototypes capture interpretable concepts like "woman" and enable targeted model edits.

Conclusion: ProtoT demonstrates that interpretable-by-design autoregressive language models can approach state-of-the-art performance while providing transparent reasoning pathways, paving the way for more trustworthy AI systems with editable behavior and interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRCsim simulation framework generates VRC cooperative perception data, enabling creation of VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying. Talk2DM module adds natural-language querying to VRC dynamic maps using chain-of-prompt mechanism, achieving over 93% accuracy with 2-5 second response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic map systems for vehicle-road-cloud cooperative autonomous driving lack natural-language-supported human interfaces, limiting human-DM interaction despite successful real-world deployments in Japan.

Method: Developed VRCsim simulation framework to generate streaming VRC cooperative perception data, constructed VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying, and proposed Talk2DM plug-and-play module using chain-of-prompt mechanism that integrates human-defined rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy on VRC-QA dataset with average response times of 2-5 seconds using models like Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss. Larger models show higher accuracy but suffer efficiency degradation.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully extends VRC dynamic map systems with natural-language querying capabilities, demonstrating strong generalization across different LLMs and practical potential for real-world deployment in vehicle-road-cloud cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics and cannot dynamically adapt to environmental changes or robustly handle unexpected failures, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through meaningful collaboration.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation as a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, incorporating transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications, intent clarity, and trust mechanisms between parties.

Result: The framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators/delegatees in complex delegation networks and aims to inform development of protocols for the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: An adaptive delegation framework addressing authority, responsibility, accountability, and trust mechanisms is needed to enable AI agents to effectively collaborate on complex tasks in dynamic environments.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) jointly learns SAEs with parent-child relationships to capture hierarchical feature structures in LLMs, improving feature alignment while preserving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders extract monosemantic features in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical language structure, particularly through "feature splitting" phenomena, requiring methods to discover multi-scale conceptual relationships.

Method: HSAE jointly learns a series of SAEs and parent-child relationships between features using two novel mechanisms: structural constraint loss and random feature perturbation to strengthen parent-child alignment while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Result: HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies across various LLMs and layers, validated by qualitative case studies and quantitative metrics, while preserving SAE reconstruction quality and interpretability across dictionary sizes.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures in LLM representations, advancing beyond isolated feature extraction to capture hierarchical language organization.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) framework enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing detail of uncertain content instead of binary abstention, improving factual accuracy while preserving information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to factual errors that limit adoption in high-risk settings. Current uncertainty estimation uses binary abstention which is too restrictive in long-form generation, discarding valuable information when confidence is low.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Proposes Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. Develops end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation with factual correctness as risk measure and information-theoretic coverage.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms baselines, improving area under risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating better accuracy and reliability while preserving original meaning.

Conclusion: Selective Abstraction provides effective alternative to binary abstention for LLMs, enabling better trade-off between specificity and reliability by reducing detail of uncertain content rather than discarding it entirely.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE introduces a DAG-based framework for alpha factor mining that treats factor pools as interconnected ecosystems, using Bayesian retrieval and DAG-aware generation to improve predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha mining methods lack global structural perspective, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity. Current paradigms (Decoupled Factor Generation and Iterative Factor Evolution) fail to capture the interconnected nature of factor evolution.

Method: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where factors are nodes and evolutionary links are edges. The framework has two core components: 1) Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation/exploration through posterior probability modeling, and 2) DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages full ancestral traces to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate AlphaPROBE achieves significant improvements in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology through DAG-based modeling is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery, providing a more structured approach to factor mining that reduces redundancy and enhances diversity.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

TL;DR: MEME proposes a logic-oriented framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of investment narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines through semantic consensus extraction and temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantitative finance methods are either asset-centric (individual stock prediction) or market-centric (portfolio allocation), but remain agnostic to the underlying reasoning driving market movements. There's a need to model financial markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment narratives to capture the evolutionary nature of market logic.

Method: MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments, uses Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus in semantic space, and implements temporal evaluation/alignment mechanisms to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of evolving market modes (Modes of Thought).

Result: Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools (2023-2025) show MEME consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study, and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to evolving market consensus.

Conclusion: MEME successfully operationalizes a logic-oriented perspective on financial markets, modeling them as evolutionary ecosystems of competing narratives. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME guides portfolio construction with robust reasoning and demonstrates superior performance in identifying and adapting to market consensus evolution.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

TL;DR: Gaia2 is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in realistic asynchronous environments with temporal constraints, dynamic events, and collaboration requirements, featuring action-level evaluation and verifiable rewards for RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior evaluations are static or synchronous, lacking realistic asynchronous environments where agents must handle temporal constraints, adapt to dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents.

Method: Gaia2 introduces scenarios with independently evolving environments, paired with write-action verifiers for fine-grained action-level evaluation. Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments (ARE) platform, it enables reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards.

Result: Evaluation shows no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 achieves 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks; Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy/speed for cost; Kimi-K2 leads open-source models with 21% pass@1. Results reveal trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: Gaia2 exposes challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap and provides a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems through the open-source ARE framework.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

TL;DR: CSEval is a framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their prompts, addressing limitations of existing metrics that focus only on realism/diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation mainly assess image realism or diversity, but fail to capture whether generated images reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology. This gap is critical for safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Method: Proposes Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated images and their conditioning prompts. The approach evaluates whether generated images accurately reflect the intended clinical semantics described in the prompts.

Result: Experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. The framework provides clinically meaningful evaluation that complements existing methods.

Conclusion: CSEval offers a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from models' reasoning processes to enhance LLM performance on reasoning tasks without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning through behavior-related prompt adjustments are intuitive but lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral pattern perspective.

Method: 1. Observes that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types. 2. Proposes two optimization methods: InjectCorrect (imitates behavioral patterns from past correct answers) and InjectRLOpt (learns value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference).

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter modifications, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Models' reasoning behaviors can be systematically analyzed and leveraged to enhance reasoning performance through behavioral pattern injection, providing effective parameter-free optimization methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

*Xinyu Yang,Chenlong Deng,Tongyu Wen,Binyu Xie,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LawThinker is an autonomous legal research agent that uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with atomic verification after each knowledge exploration step to ensure procedurally compliant legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain, compromising procedural compliance.

Method: LawThinker employs an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, plus a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves 24% improvement over direct reasoning and 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. It also shows generalization capability on three static benchmarks.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the procedural compliance gap in legal reasoning by enforcing atomic verification after each exploration step, demonstrating significant performance improvements and generalization across both dynamic and static legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

### [94] [Differentiable Modal Logic for Multi-Agent Diagnosis, Orchestration and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12083)
*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data in multi-agent systems, providing interpretable neurosymbolic debugging for epistemic, temporal, deontic, and doxastic modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real multi-agent systems, making debugging semantic failures challenging. As AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, there's a need for formal reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) that learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone. The framework uses four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (causality), deontic (permissions), and doxastic (confidence interpretation). Logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives.

Result: The approach provides interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters rather than opaque embeddings. It enables knowledge injection via differentiable axioms for learning with sparse data, compositional multi-modal reasoning combining epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints, and practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control, and communication of multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML offers a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework for multi-agent systems that can discover deceptive alliances, detect LLM hallucinations, and provide interpretable reasoning about complex agent interactions, with complete implementations provided as executable Jupyter notebooks.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

*Xiaoyuan Liu,Tian Liang,Dongyang Ma,Deyu Zhou,Haitao Mi,Pinjia He,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StateLM introduces foundation models with internal reasoning loops and memory tools that actively manage their own context, enabling dynamic context engineering and stateful reasoning across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models lack agency to actively manage their memory/context despite having mature database and retrieval systems, remaining passive recipients of manually engineered context within fixed architectural constraints.

Method: Introduces StateLM, a new class of foundation models with internal reasoning loops equipped with memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking) and trained to actively manage these tools for dynamic context engineering.

Result: StateLMs outperform standard LLMs across all model scales on long-document QA tasks, achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks, and show dramatic improvements on deep research tasks (52% vs 5% accuracy on BrowseComp-Plus).

Conclusion: StateLM transforms LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents, enabling stateful and manageable reasoning processes by breaking free from fixed context window limitations through active context management.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that reduces excessive reflection in Large Reasoning Models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reasoning steps and coordinating penalties based on problem complexity, achieving significant reductions in response length while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often generate over-long chains-of-thought with excessive reflection (repetitive self-questioning, circular reasoning), leading to high token consumption, computational overhead, and latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models. Increasing problem complexity exacerbates this issue, reducing accuracy while increasing token overhead.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a reinforcement learning framework with two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. These coordinated penalties encourage more concise and effective reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluated on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models. For the 1.5B model: 53.1% reduction in average response length with 5.8% accuracy improvement. For the 7B model: 35.0% reduction in length with 2.7% accuracy gain. Achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ARLCP effectively addresses the problem of excessive reflection in Large Reasoning Models by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy through adaptive penalties, resulting in more concise reasoning paths with improved performance across different model sizes.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSFMs provide zero-shot priors for data-sparse university enrolment forecasting, performing on par with classical methods without institution-specific training when using leakage-safe covariates and regime indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure and need accurate enrolment forecasts, but face data-sparsity issues with short annual series, reporting changes, and regime shifts that make classical approaches unreliable.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting with leakage-safe covariate set, introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) as regime covariate from documentary evidence, and use Google Trends demand proxies with stabilizing feature engineering in expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

Conclusion: TSFMs with carefully constructed leakage-safe covariates and regime indicators offer viable zero-shot alternatives for data-sparse institutional enrolment forecasting, addressing limitations of classical approaches.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLA (Hadamard Linear Attention) is a new linear attention variant that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities, resulting in a higher-degree rational approximation to softmax, with efficient computation and no tensor reshaping needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers is computationally expensive. Linear attention was proposed as an efficient approximation but uses low-degree rational functions to approximate softmax, applying nonlinearity separately to queries and keys before similarity computation.

Method: Proposes Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) which, unlike previous linear attention methods, applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (analogous to standard softmax attention). This results in a higher-degree rational function approximation to softmax. The method derives an efficient computational scheme similar to standard linear attention without requiring time-consuming tensor reshaping.

Result: The effectiveness of HLA is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens, showing practical benefits for computationally intensive tasks.

Conclusion: HLA provides a more accurate approximation to standard softmax attention than previous linear attention methods while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for applications with large token sequences like video generation.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neutral prompts in commercial image generators (Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT Image 1.5) produce highly biased outputs, with strong "default white" bias (>96%) and divergent gender preferences, demonstrating that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone bias in widely deployed models using rigorous methodology.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts across two models. Employed hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales for illumination-aware colorimetric analysis.

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models exhibited strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). Models diverged on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing embedded biases. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework measuring how alignment interventions reshape interconnected value systems beyond target gains, revealing systemic risks invisible to conventional evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment work treats values statically, ignoring how interventions (prompting, fine-tuning, preference optimization) reshape the broader value system and create systemic propagation effects.

Method: Introduce Value Alignment Tax (VAT) framework; use controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory; collect paired pre-post normative judgments; analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment produces uneven, structured co-movement among values; these systemic effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation; reveals process-level alignment risks.

Conclusion: VAT framework reveals hidden systemic risks in value alignment, offering new insights into the dynamics of how alignment interventions reshape interconnected value systems in LLMs.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive large model evaluation is prohibitively expensive, creating need for performance prediction from limited observations. Existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR combines data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning. Uses specialized retrievers for external knowledge, embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) for statistical expectations with uncertainty. Reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation with traceable explanations.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, achieving 14.46% gain in total score over strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity (only 1-2 observed scores per test model).

Conclusion: STAR effectively bridges statistical and knowledge-driven approaches to predict model performance from sparse observations, providing reliable predictions with traceable explanations while addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

TL;DR: A novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with T5 language model to compress data into token sequences rather than dense vectors, achieving higher compression ratios while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data structures, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for compression methods that preserve data format while achieving better compression ratios.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning applied to T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences. Employs off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimizing redundancy. Works independently of external grammatical or world knowledge by leveraging latent information within language models.

Result: Significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. The approach effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, maintaining semantic integrity while achieving higher compression efficiency.

Conclusion: The RL-based token sequence compression method offers a robust and practical solution that preserves data structure better than traditional approaches, paving the way for improved compression across various applications.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show social task proficiency but lack coherent Theory of Mind representations, failing logical equivalence tests and showing inconsistency between action predictions and mental state inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) beyond surface-level social task performance, using a cognitively-grounded definition that tests for causal mental state models rather than just benchmark success.

Method: Developed a new evaluation framework based on cognitive science principles that probes whether LLMs have coherent, domain-general, and consistent causal models of how mental states cause behavior, testing both simple ToM paradigms and logically equivalent tasks.

Result: LLMs succeed at approximating human judgments in simple ToM tasks but fail at logically equivalent tasks and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Conclusion: The social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind, suggesting they lack the actual causal mental state representations posited by ToM theory.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Result: Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate enhanced complex reasoning capabilities and strong scalability, facilitating more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE enables LLMs to self-evolve as both solver and verifier, improving scientific reasoning through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning with geometric rewards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks (QBBN) to include negation and backward reasoning, adds a typed logical language for semantics, and develops a typed slot grammar for syntax parsing, using LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation while QBBN handles inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key limitations in previous QBBN work: lack of negation/backward reasoning capabilities and absence of natural language parsing. The paper aims to create a complete system that integrates formal semantics with modern LLM capabilities, reconciling traditional formal NLP approaches with Sutton's "bitter lesson" about learning from data.

Method: 1. Extends QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1 to enable contrapositive reasoning via backward lambda messages. 2. Develops a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness. 3. Creates a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form. 4. Uses LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation, grammar for parsing, LLM for reranking, and QBBN for inference.

Result: The extended QBBN engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. The typed slot grammar achieves 33/33 correct parses with zero ambiguity. LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy for disambiguation but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming the necessity of grammars. The complete architecture successfully integrates LLM preprocessing, grammar parsing, LLM reranking, and QBBN inference.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses previous gaps by extending QBBN with negation/backward reasoning and adding natural language parsing capabilities. It demonstrates that LLMs can eliminate the annotation bottleneck that hindered formal NLP while QBBN serves as a verifier, reconciling formal semantics with data-driven approaches. The architecture leverages LLMs for preprocessing and disambiguation while maintaining structured parsing through grammars and formal inference through QBBNs.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IOA framework applies educational principles (Bloom's Mastery Learning, Vygotsky's ZPD) to LLM knowledge distillation via a three-stage pipeline that systematically identifies knowledge gaps, organizes progressive curricula, and adapts representations to student capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process, which limits effective knowledge transfer to smaller models.

Method: Proposes a three-stage IOA pipeline: Knowledge Identifier (detects student deficiencies), Organizer (creates progressive curricula with controlled difficulty increments), and Adapter (adjusts representations to student cognitive capacity). Integrates Bloom's Mastery Learning and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development principles.

Result: IOA achieves 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval using <1/10th parameters, with 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared to SOTA baselines. Particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Pedagogically-inspired distillation framework significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that systematic educational principles can dramatically improve knowledge transfer efficiency from large to small language models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder size by 88% while maintaining segmentation performance by replacing SAM3's large text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation, based on analysis showing severe redundancy in segmentation prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large, general-purpose text encoders designed for open-ended language understanding, but segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. Analysis of 404,796 real prompts reveals severe redundancy in context window utilization, vocabulary usage, and text embedding dimensions.

Method: Proposes SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized by knowledge distillation. The approach is based on findings from large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original SAM3 model on image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The redundancy in segmentation prompts enables significant model compression without performance degradation, demonstrating that lightweight text encoders can effectively replace large general-purpose encoders in vision-language segmentation tasks while reducing computational and memory overhead.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

### [108] ["Sorry, I Didn't Catch That": How Speech Models Miss What Matters Most](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12249)
*Kaitlyn Zhou,Martijn Bartelds,Federico Bianchi,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes street name transcriptions with 44% error rate, disproportionately affecting non-English speakers; synthetic data fine-tuning improves accuracy by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite low word error rates on benchmarks, speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments, particularly for street name transcription which has significant downstream consequences for navigation and location-based services.

Method: Evaluated 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on linguistically diverse U.S. speakers' street name recordings; introduced synthetic data generation using open-source text-to-speech models to produce diverse pronunciations of named entities; fine-tuned models with <1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% on street names; routing distance errors twice as large for non-English primary speakers; fine-tuning with synthetic data improved street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems; synthetic data generation provides a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors and addressing performance disparities for linguistically diverse speakers.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

*Jianke Yang,Ohm Venkatachalam,Mohammad Kianezhad,Sharvaree Vadgama,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based agentic framework for symbolic equation discovery that mimics scientific reasoning by first extracting physical properties, then using them to configure symbolic regression engines, outperforming direct LLM and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems for symbolic equation discovery directly guess equations from data without modeling the multi-step scientific reasoning process where scientists first infer physical properties (like symmetries) and use them as priors to constrain candidate equations.

Method: KeplerAgent is an agentic framework that coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure (physical properties), then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines (PySINDy, PySR) by setting their function libraries and structural constraints based on the inferred physical priors.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data compared to both LLM baselines and traditional symbolic regression methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the scientific reasoning process (inferring physical properties first, then using them as priors) in an agentic framework significantly improves symbolic equation discovery performance over direct equation guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

*Zhen Zhang,Kaiqiang Song,Xun Wang,Yebowen Hu,Weixiang Yan,Chenyang Zhao,Henry Peng Zou,Haoyun Deng,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Shujian Liu,Simin Ma,Xiaoyang Wang,Xin Eric Wang,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework for multi-turn tool-using AI agents that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards, decomposing behaviors into fine-grained binary criteria with evidence grounding, trained in LLM-simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying reinforcement learning to real-world AI agent tasks is difficult because realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is underexplored, and building/maintaining executable tool environments is costly and limits scale.

Method: CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into classification-style decisions. It uses sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria, and trains in scalable LLM-simulated tool environments to avoid heavy engineering for large tool sets.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox. Results match or outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, demonstrating consistent improvements over supervised fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage compared to uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior on multi-step agentic tasks is poorly understood. Uniform per-step compute allocation shows diminishing returns in long-horizon environments, and small errors compound over time.

Method: CATTS uses vote-derived uncertainty statistics (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) from the agent's own vote distribution to dynamically allocate compute only when decisions are contentious. It avoids uniform scaling by identifying genuinely uncertain steps.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. It provides both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware test-time scaling using vote-derived uncertainty is an effective approach for multi-step agents, offering performance improvements with computational efficiency by dynamically allocating compute to uncertain decision points.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
