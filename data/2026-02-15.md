### [1] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Continuous Navigation via Memory-Augmented Kalman Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11183)
*Yin Tang,Jiawei Ma,Jinrui Zhang,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Deyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroKalman: A Bayesian state estimation framework for UAV vision-language navigation that addresses state drift by decoupling navigation into prior prediction and likelihood correction using attention-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN models for UAVs suffer from accumulated position errors (state drift) due to dead-reckoning stepwise navigation, causing misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates that compromises trajectory prediction.

Method: Formulates sequential prediction as recursive Bayesian state estimation, decoupling navigation into Prior Prediction (based on motion dynamics) and Likelihood Correction (from historical observation). Associates Kernel Density Estimation of measurement likelihood with attention-based retrieval to rectify latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark show the method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation with only 10% of training data fine-tuning.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman effectively addresses state drift in UAV navigation by integrating Bayesian state estimation with attention-based retrieval, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction with minimal training data requirements.

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

### [2] [H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291)
*Wenyuan Chen,Jinbang Huang,Oscar Pang,Zhiyuan Li,Xiao Hu,Lingfeng Zhang,Zhanguang Zhang,Mark Coates,Tongtong Cao,Xingyue Quan,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-WM is a hierarchical world model that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions in a unified bilevel framework, combining symbolic reasoning's long-horizon robustness with visual grounding to mitigate error accumulation in robotic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models for robotics either focus on video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional symbolic planning methods operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) with a bilevel framework: high-level logical world model for symbolic state transitions and low-level visual world model for perceptual predictions. Introduces a robotic dataset aligning robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations for training.

Result: Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach. The hierarchical outputs provide stable intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences.

Conclusion: H-WM successfully integrates robot-executable symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations, creating a unified framework that addresses limitations of both pure visual prediction methods and traditional symbolic planning approaches for robotic control.

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

### [3] [ExtremControl: Low-Latency Humanoid Teleoperation with Direct Extremity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11321)
*Ziyan Xiong,Lixing Fang,Junyun Huang,Kashu Yamazaki,Hao Zhang,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExtremControl is a low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that uses SE(3) poses of selected links, Cartesian-space mapping, and velocity feedforward to achieve 50ms latency, enabling responsive tasks like ping-pong ball balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid teleoperation systems suffer from substantial latency due to heavy pre-processing for motion retargeting and position-only PD control, which limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions.

Method: ExtremControl operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links (primarily extremities), uses Cartesian-space mapping to convert human motion to humanoid link targets, and incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level for responsiveness under rapidly changing control interfaces.

Result: The system achieves end-to-end latency as low as 50ms, substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit of prior work, and enables highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: ExtremControl provides an effective low-latency whole-body control framework for humanoid teleoperation that overcomes the latency limitations of existing approaches, enabling responsive dynamic tasks through its direct SE(3) pose control, Cartesian-space mapping, and velocity feedforward architecture.

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MolmoSpaces is an open ecosystem with 230k+ diverse indoor environments and 130k annotated objects for large-scale robot policy benchmarking, featuring simulator-agnostic support and strong sim-to-real correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployment requires robustness to countless variations in scenes and tasks that are underrepresented in existing benchmarks, necessitating infrastructure at a scale that physical evaluation alone cannot provide.

Method: Created MolmoSpaces with 230k+ diverse indoor environments (handcrafted and procedurally generated), 130k richly annotated objects (48k manipulable with 42M stable grasps), simulator-agnostic support for MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill, and MolmoSpaces-Bench with 8 benchmark tasks.

Result: MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, ρ = 0.98), confirms newer zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions, and identifies key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion.

Conclusion: MolmoSpaces provides a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research through its open-source assets and tooling.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

### [5] [Human Preference Modeling Using Visual Motion Prediction Improves Robot Skill Learning from Egocentric Human Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11393)
*Mrinal Verghese,Christopher G. Atkeson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot learning method that models human preferences from egocentric videos by predicting object motion and using this as a reward function, optimized on-robot with SAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior reward learning from human videos has limitations: they measure long-term value based on temporal distance to terminal states, make restrictive assumptions, and require transferring learned value functions across embodiment/environment gaps. These limitations hinder performance when learning from video demonstrations.

Method: Learn human preferences by predicting motion of tracked points between subsequent images. Define reward function as agreement between predicted and observed object motion in robot behavior. Use modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate value function from this reward and optimize policy that maximizes value function, all executed directly on the robot.

Result: Policies learned with this reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on real robots. The approach demonstrates capability for real robot learning.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the embodiment gap by learning human preferences from egocentric videos through motion prediction, enabling effective robot learning directly on physical hardware without requiring extensive value function transfer across domains.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

### [6] [EasyMimic: A Low-Cost Framework for Robot Imitation Learning from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11464)
*Tao Zhang,Song Xia,Ye Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EasyMimic enables low-cost robots to learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations using 3D hand trajectory extraction, action alignment, hand visual augmentation, and co-training with minimal robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high cost of collecting large-scale real-world robot data, particularly for low-cost home robots that need to be user-friendly and affordable, by enabling learning from human video demonstrations.

Method: Extracts 3D hand trajectories from RGB videos, aligns them to robot gripper control space, uses hand visual augmentation to bridge human-robot domain gap, and employs co-training with both human and limited robot data for rapid adaptation.

Result: Achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks on the low-cost LeRobot platform, significantly reducing reliance on expensive robot data collection.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, low-cost solution for bringing intelligent robots into homes by enabling rapid policy learning from human demonstrations with minimal robot data requirements.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

### [7] [Effective Task Planning with Missing Objects using Learning-Informed Object Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11468)
*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A planning framework that integrates object search policies (LIOS actions) into task planning, enabling robots to plan when object locations are unknown by interleaving search and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task planning (e.g., PDDL) assumes full environment knowledge and cannot handle unknown object locations. Existing learning-driven object search approaches operate standalone and are not easily integrated into full task planners that need to determine what objects are necessary and when to search for them.

Method: Develops a planning framework with novel model-based LIOS (Learning-Informed Object Search) actions, each representing a policy to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic, using model-based calculations of expected cost to generate plans that interleave search and execution.

Result: Outperforms both non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal preparation in simulated ProcTHOR homes and real-world experiments. The approach effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty about object locations, bridging the gap between object search methods and full task planning.

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

### [8] [HyperDet: 3D Object Detection with Hyper 4D Radar Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11554)
*Yichun Xiao,Runwei Guan,Fangqiang Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperDet is a detector-agnostic framework that refines sparse 4D radar point clouds to make them compatible with standard LiDAR-oriented 3D detectors through multi-frame aggregation, cross-sensor validation, and foreground-focused diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar offers weather robustness and velocity awareness at lower cost than LiDAR, but radar-only 3D detection underperforms due to sparse, irregular point clouds corrupted by multipath noise, resulting in weak geometry that hinders standard LiDAR-oriented detectors.

Method: HyperDet constructs task-aware hyper 4D radar point clouds by: 1) aggregating returns from multiple surround-view radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage/density; 2) applying geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with self-consistency checks to suppress inconsistent returns; 3) integrating a foreground-focused diffusion module with mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while enhancing radar attributes (Doppler, RCS), distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference.

Result: On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves detection performance over raw radar inputs with both VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint detectors, partially narrowing the performance gap between radar and LiDAR-based systems.

Conclusion: Input-level refinement enables radar point clouds to better leverage existing LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications, demonstrating that radar-only 3D detection can be improved through preprocessing rather than detector redesign.

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

### [9] [ReaDy-Go: Real-to-Sim Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting Simulation for Environment-Specific Visual Navigation with Moving Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11575)
*Seungyeon Yoo,Youngseok Jang,Dabin Kim,Youngsoo Han,Seungwoo Jung,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReaDy-Go is a real-to-sim pipeline that generates photorealistic dynamic navigation datasets by combining static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes with animatable human avatars, enabling training of robust navigation policies for real-world dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation models face challenges in real-world dynamic environments due to sim-to-real gaps and difficulty training policies for specific deployment environments; existing real-to-sim approaches assume static scenes or unrealistic dynamics, despite the need for safe navigation in dynamic settings.

Method: Three-component pipeline: (1) Dynamic GS simulator integrating scene GS with human animation module for inserting animatable human avatars and synthesizing plausible motions from 2D trajectories; (2) Navigation dataset generation using the simulator, robot expert planner for dynamic GS representations, and human planner; (3) Policy learning with generated datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance after sim-to-real transfer and in presence of moving obstacles; demonstrates generalization potential through zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in unseen environments.

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go successfully addresses limitations of existing real-to-sim approaches by generating photorealistic dynamic scenarios, enabling training of robust navigation policies that transfer effectively to real-world dynamic environments with moving obstacles.

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fragmentation in embodied navigation research where different tasks typically require specialized architectures. The authors aim to create a unified foundation model that can handle multiple navigation tasks with a single architecture, enabling more general and capable navigation agents.

Conclusion: The paper presents a successful unification of embodied navigation tasks through a single foundation model architecture. The hierarchical Brain-Action design effectively combines semantic reasoning with precise action generation, while the large-scale training data enables robust performance across diverse navigation scenarios. The work represents significant progress toward general-purpose navigation agents capable of handling complex, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.

Abstract: Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following. ABot-N0 utilizes a hierarchical ``Brain-Action'' architecture, pairing an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning with a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for precise, continuous trajectory generation.
  To support large-scale learning, we developed the ABot-N0 Data Engine, curating 16.9M expert trajectories and 5.0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes (10.7 $\text{km}^2$). ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models. Furthermore, our Agentic Navigation System integrates a planner with hierarchical topological memory, enabling robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.

*Yufeng Tian,Shuiqi Cheng,Tianming Wei,Tianxing Zhou,Yuanhang Zhang,Zixian Liu,Qianwei Han,Zhecheng Yuan,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTaS is a visuo-tactile robotic manipulation framework that uses Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning and CVAE to better exploit modality alignment and complementarity, outperforming baselines in simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile approaches focus on feature alignment but use simple concatenation, failing to effectively handle occluded scenarios by neglecting modality complementarity and underutilizing alignment, limiting real-world deployment potential.

Method: ViTaS framework with Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning (advanced contrastive learning) and CVAE module to leverage both alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations for robotic manipulation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ViTaS provides a simple yet effective framework that successfully incorporates both visual and tactile information by better exploiting modality alignment and complementarity, enabling improved performance in robotic manipulation tasks including occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

*Faezeh Vahedi,Morteza Memari,Ramtin Tabatabaei,Alireza Taheri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops neural network models (LSTM and Transformer) to predict human gaze behavior in social interactions, including responses to non-human stimuli, and deploys the system on a NAO robot for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to adapt their gaze behavior like humans to enhance communication effectiveness. Current research lacks investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, which is crucial for robots to remain receptive to all environmental cues in social interactions.

Method: Collected gaze data from 41 participants using VR glasses in simulated social scenarios (3D animation and 360° real-world video). Preprocessed data trained LSTM and Transformer neural networks to predict gaze patterns. System deployed on NAO robot and evaluated by 275 participants via questionnaire.

Result: LSTM achieved 67.6% (animation) and 72% (real-world) accuracy; Transformer achieved 70.4% (animation) and 71.6% (real-world) accuracy. Models outperform existing approaches and uniquely handle non-human stimuli. Questionnaire results showed high user satisfaction with robot interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts, including responses to non-human stimuli, improving communication effectiveness and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Conclusion: AC-MASAC effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous UAV swarm path planning through attentive curriculum learning, demonstrating superior performance in cooperative navigation tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

TL;DR: HAIC is a unified framework for humanoid robots to robustly interact with diverse underactuated objects using only proprioceptive sensing, without external state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-Object Interaction methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to robots, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions.

Method: HAIC uses a dynamics predictor to estimate high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) from proprioceptive history, projects these onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, and employs asymmetric fine-tuning where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain.

Conclusion: HAIC provides a unified framework for robust interaction with diverse object dynamics using only proprioceptive sensing, enabling humanoid robots to handle underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints without external state estimation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

### [15] [LAMP: Implicit Language Map for Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11862)
*Sibaek Lee,Hyeonwoo Yu,Giseop Kim,Sunwook Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAMP introduces a neural language field-based navigation framework that learns continuous, language-driven maps for efficient zero-shot navigation, outperforming explicit methods in memory efficiency and goal-reaching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods using explicit language vector storage in grid/node-based maps suffer from excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning, especially in large environments.

Method: LAMP encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than explicit storage, combines it with a sparse graph for coarse planning, then performs gradient-based optimization for fine-grained path refinement. It uses Bayesian uncertainty modeling with von Mises-Fisher distribution and graph sampling for scalability.

Result: LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy in experiments conducted in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and real multi-floor building environments.

Conclusion: The neural language field approach enables efficient, scalable zero-shot navigation with precise path generation, addressing limitations of explicit language map representations through continuous implicit encoding and gradient-guided optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using bounding-box instructions instead of just text to improve diffusion policies for semantic manipulation in robotics, introduces an automated data collection system, and discovers scaling laws showing improved generalization with more bounding-box object data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based policies for semantic manipulation have limited generalization in real-world robotics due to inadequate target object specification using only text instructions in complex environments.

Method: Proposes bounding-box instructions to specify target objects directly, develops Label-UMI handheld segmentation device with automated annotation pipeline for efficient data collection, and creates a semantic-motion-decoupled framework integrating object detection with bounding-box guided diffusion policy.

Result: Validated effectiveness through extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, revealed power-law relationship between generalization performance and number of bounding-box objects, and achieved 85% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects.

Conclusion: Bounding-box instructions significantly improve diffusion policy generalization for semantic manipulation, data scaling laws exist in these tasks, and the proposed data collection strategy enables high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid controllers struggle with motion diversity, slow adaptation, and balance maintenance in dynamic scenarios, often requiring task-specific training or suffering performance degradation when adapting to new motions.

Method: FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation (learning lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints) and Center-of-Mass-Aware Control (incorporating CoM observations and objectives for balance).

Result: Extensive simulation and real-world experiments show FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: FAST provides an effective framework for general humanoid whole-body control that enables fast adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while maintaining stable motion tracking and robust balance.

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

*Yu Deng,Yufeng Jin,Xiaogang Jia,Jiahong Xue,Gerhard Neumann,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot-DIFT distills geometric priors from diffusion models into deterministic visual backbones to improve robot manipulation by addressing the structural mismatch between semantic-invariant vision encoders and fine-grained control requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision encoders for robot manipulation have a structural mismatch: they optimize for semantic invariance (good for classification) but manipulation requires geometric sensitivity to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. This creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control.

Method: Proposes Robot-DIFT framework using Manifold Distillation to decouple geometric information from inference. Distills a frozen diffusion teacher model into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), retaining rich geometric priors while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift.

Result: Pretrained on large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Conclusion: The key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but the structural mismatch between visual backbones and physical control requirements. By distilling diffusion model geometric priors into deterministic networks, Robot-DIFT bridges this gap effectively.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

TL;DR: AGPS replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent to automate robot RL training, improving sample efficiency through semantic guidance and exploration pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for robot manipulation suffers from severe sample inefficiency. Human-in-the-Loop methods accelerate training but face scalability limitations due to 1:1 supervision ratio, operator fatigue, and inconsistent human proficiency.

Method: Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS) replaces human supervisors with a multimodal agent that acts as a semantic world model. The agent injects intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration and provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning using executable tools.

Result: AGPS outperforms Human-in-the-Loop methods in sample efficiency on two manipulation tasks (precision insertion and deformable object manipulation), automating the supervision pipeline for labor-free and scalable robot learning.

Conclusion: AGPS successfully automates robot RL training by replacing human supervisors with multimodal agents, enabling scalable, labor-free learning while maintaining or improving sample efficiency compared to human-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAPF approaches have limitations: open-loop planners generate fixed trajectories that struggle with disturbances, while closed-loop heuristics lack reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments like automated warehouses and logistics.

Method: ACCBS builds on a finite-horizon variant of CBS (Conflict-Based Search) with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC (Model Predictive Control). It dynamically adjusts planning horizon based on computational budget and reuses a single constraint tree for seamless horizon transitions.

Result: ACCBS produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as computational budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies show it combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees.

Conclusion: ACCBS effectively bridges the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment, offering both disturbance flexibility and performance guarantees for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics.

This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

*Jingxian Lu,Wenke Xia,Yuxuan Wu,Zhiwu Lu,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-proprioception policies suffer from proprioception dominating learning during motion-transition phases, limiting visual modality's role. GAP algorithm adaptively modulates proprioception gradients based on phase probabilities to enable better collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioception is critical for robotic servo control, and its collaboration with vision is expected to enhance manipulation policies. However, inconsistent observations exist regarding the generalization of vision-proprioception policies, particularly during motion-transition phases where vision's role appears limited.

Method: Proposed Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm: uses proprioception to estimate probability of each timestep belonging to motion-transition phases, then applies fine-grained adjustment that reduces proprioception gradient magnitude based on estimated probabilities during policy learning.

Result: GAP enables robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into developing vision-proprioception policies by addressing proprioception dominance during motion-transition phases through adaptive gradient modulation, enabling dynamic collaboration between modalities.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution, where traditional methods may fail due to distributional drift.

Method: Uses weighted conformal prediction with learned state-control-dependent covariance to derive high-confidence model error bounds, integrated into SLS-based robust nonlinear MPC with constraint tightening via volume-optimized forward reachable sets.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, analyzes impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage, and demonstrates empirical improvements on nonlinear systems (4D car, 12D quadcopter) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables safe and robust out-of-distribution planning with formal guarantees, improving safety and robustness especially outside the training data distribution.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world policy rollout collection is expensive, and existing world models lack physical fidelity for policy improvement due to limited demonstration datasets and poor modeling of critical physical details in contact-rich manipulation.

Method: Proposes an iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world rollout data to enhance world model fidelity, then uses the improved model to generate supplemental synthetic data for VLA model training.

Result: Achieves 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with generated synthetic rollouts on real robot experiments with multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of world models with real-world data enables effective synthetic data generation for VLA model improvement, addressing physical fidelity limitations of existing simulators.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

Motivation: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration in communication-limited environments like caves, where traditional approaches suffer from unnecessary backtracking and inefficient information sharing.

Method: Introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on real-time signal strength and data payload size. ART-SST extension enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery.

Result: Through 480+ simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperformed existing strategies (full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristics), achieving up to 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

### [28] [Pack it in: Packing into Partially Filled Containers Through Contact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12095)
*David Russell,Zisong Xu,Maximo A. Roa,Mehmet Dogar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Contact-aware bin-packing approach that uses purposeful object interactions to create space in partially filled containers, integrating trajectory optimization, physics-aware perception, and feasible placement suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warehouse automation requires efficient bin-packing, but existing methods focus on empty containers and collision-free strategies, ignoring real-world scenarios where containers are partially filled with suboptimal arrangements due to transportation.

Method: Contact-aware packing approach using: 1) contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within model predictive controller for purposeful interactions, 2) physics-aware perception system for pose estimation during occlusions, 3) method for suggesting physically-feasible placement locations.

Result: The approach enables successful placement of new items into partially filled containers by exploiting purposeful interactions to create free space, overcoming limitations of traditional collision-free strategies.

Conclusion: Contact-aware packing with purposeful object interactions provides a practical solution for real-world warehouse bin-packing scenarios where containers are often partially filled with suboptimal arrangements.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

*Itamar Mishani,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multi-Graph Search (MGS) generalizes classical search algorithms to a multi-graph setting for efficient high-dimensional motion planning, maintaining completeness and bounded-suboptimality while generating consistent motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-dimensional motion planning algorithms often trade off between scalability and motion quality, generating unpredictable/inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources, creating a need for more efficient and reliable planning methods.

Method: Multi-Graph Search (MGS) generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to maintain and incrementally expand multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions and allowing disconnected subgraphs to merge through feasible transitions.

Result: MGS is proven to be complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirical demonstrations show its effectiveness on manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks, with benchmarks and code available online.

Conclusion: MGS provides an effective search-based motion planning approach for high-dimensional robotic systems that balances computational efficiency with motion quality, addressing limitations of existing methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

*Wancai Zheng,Hao Chen,Xianlong Lu,Linlin Ou,Xinyi Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3DGSNav is a zero-shot object navigation framework that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting as persistent memory for VLMs, enabling enhanced spatial reasoning through active perception and trajectory-guided rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods rely on scene abstractions (semantic maps or textual representations) that constrain high-level decision making by low-level perception accuracy. There's a need for better spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Incremental construction of 3DGS representation as persistent memory for VLMs, trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views, structured visual prompts with Chain-of-Thought prompting, real-time object detection filtering, and VLM-driven active viewpoint switching for target re-verification.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 3DGSNav provides an effective framework for zero-shot object navigation by leveraging 3DGS as persistent memory for VLMs, enhancing spatial reasoning capabilities and achieving reliable performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient gaits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric framework for analyzing optimal locomotion in slender bodies (snakes, spermatozoa, robots) that accounts for both environmental drag and internal energy dissipation during shape changes, providing a unified approach to understand biological and robotic locomotion efficiency.

Method: Formulates Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics. The model includes both external dissipation (body displacement through environment) and internal dissipation (metabolic/actuator energy for shape changes). Provides continuous model with consistent time-space discretization for numerical computation of geodesics under three boundary conditions.

Result: Optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed biological motion trajectories (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results for low-dimensional systems like Purcell's swimmers. The model reveals new insights into locomotion mechanisms of generalized Purcell's swimmers and is less geometrically rigid than previous frameworks.

Conclusion: The geometric sub-Riemannian geodesic approach provides a unified framework for analyzing optimal shape-change-induced locomotion that captures overall efficiency by accounting for both external and internal energy dissipation, with applications to biological systems and robotic design.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LDA-1B is a 1B-parameter robot foundation model that scales by ingesting universal embodied data through joint learning of dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, using structured DINO latent space and multi-modal diffusion transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models rely heavily on behavior cloning, which discards transferable dynamics knowledge in heterogeneous embodied data. Existing Unified World Model formulations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets.

Method: LDA-1B jointly learns dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting by assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. It uses prediction in a structured DINO latent space to avoid redundant pixel-space appearance modeling, and employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams for stable training at 1B-parameter scale. The model is trained on EI-30k, a standardized 30k-hour embodied interaction dataset.

Result: LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., π₀.₅) by up to 21% on contact-rich tasks, 48% on dexterous tasks, and 23% on long-horizon tasks. It enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10% improvement by leveraging 30% low-quality trajectories that are typically harmful and discarded.

Conclusion: LDA-1B demonstrates that scalable robot foundation models can be built through universal embodied data ingestion with joint learning of dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, using structured latent representations and multi-modal architectures to handle heterogeneous data effectively.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

TL;DR: AHAT is a household task planner that combines LLMs with symbolic reasoning for scalable long-horizon planning in large environments, using a novel RL algorithm (TGPO) to improve instruction decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based task planners struggle with scalability as performance degrades with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity in open-world household settings.

Method: AHAT uses an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded PDDL subgoals, then performs symbolic reasoning for optimal planning. TGPO (novel RL algorithm) integrates external correction of reasoning traces into GRPO to enhance complex intention decomposition.

Result: AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly excelling in human-style household tasks with brief instructions requiring complex execution plans.

Conclusion: The AHAT framework demonstrates that combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning and enhanced RL training enables scalable, long-horizon planning in large household environments, effectively handling ambiguous human instructions.

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

*Jacky Kwok,Xilun Zhang,Mengdi Xu,Yuejiang Liu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Chelsea Finn,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoVer introduces test-time verification with contrastive learning to reduce intention-action gaps in VLA models, using scaling laws, boot-time compute, and hierarchical verification to improve instruction following performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Vision-Language-Action models, there remains a significant "intention-action gap" where generated actions misalign with natural language instructions. The paper aims to address this gap through test-time verification rather than solely scaling pre-training.

Method: 1) Characterize test-time scaling laws showing joint scaling of rephrased instructions and generated actions improves sample diversity; 2) Propose CoVer, a contrastive verifier for VLA alignment; 3) Introduce "boot-time compute" and hierarchical verification pipeline: precompute diverse rephrased instructions from VLM, generate multiple action candidates, then use verifier to select optimal prompt and action chunks.

Result: 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on SIMPLER benchmark compared to scaling policy pre-training; 45% further improvement in real-world experiments; 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate on PolaRiS benchmark.

Conclusion: Test-time verification with CoVer effectively reduces intention-action gaps in VLA models, demonstrating that verification-based approaches can outperform traditional scaling of pre-training, with significant improvements across both simulated and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing ML use in sensitive domains raises transparency concerns, but existing XAI methods require technical expertise, creating a gap in no-code ML platforms that aim to democratize AI.

Method: Developed a human-centered XAI module in DashAI integrating three complementary techniques: Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP for tabular classification. Conducted user study with 20 participants (ML novices and experts).

Result: High task success (≥80%) across all explainability tasks; novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy (ESS α=0.74); experts were more critical of sufficiency/completeness; explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence (TiA α=0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts.

Conclusion: The study highlights the central challenge for XAI in no-code ML: making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts, demonstrating the value of human-centered design in democratizing AI explainability.

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Generative Solvers (LGS) is a two-stage framework for long-horizon PDE simulation that maps diverse PDE states to a shared latent space via VAE, learns probabilistic dynamics with Transformer via flow matching, and uses uncertainty perturbation and flow forcing to stabilize autoregressive predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems that can handle rollout drift, provide uncertainty awareness, and be computationally efficient for scalable pretraining and adaptation.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Pretrained VAE maps diverse PDE states to shared latent physics space, (2) Transformer learns probabilistic latent dynamics via flow matching. Key mechanisms: uncertainty knob for perturbing latent inputs to correct off-manifold drift, flow forcing to update system descriptors from generated trajectories for alignment.

Result: Pretrained on ~2.5M trajectories at 128² resolution across 12 PDE families. Matches deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Achieves up to 70× lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines. Shows efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution 256² Kolmogorov flow with limited finetuning.

Conclusion: LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows, enabling scalable pretraining and efficient adaptation.

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces decision-valued maps and DecisionDB infrastructure to track how different data representations affect computational outcomes, enabling deterministic replay and audit of decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different representations of the same data can lead to different computational outcomes, creating a need to systematically track which representations preserve results versus change them, and to enable reliable decision reuse and auditing.

Method: Formalizes decision-valued maps that associate data representations with discrete outcomes; develops DecisionDB infrastructure that logs, replays, and audits these relationships using content-derived identifiers and write-once artifact storage.

Result: Creates a framework that partitions representation space into persistence regions (where outcomes are preserved) and boundaries (where outcomes change), with deterministic replay that exactly recovers recorded decision identifiers from stored artifacts.

Conclusion: The approach provides a mechanically checkable condition for decision reuse and establishes infrastructure for reliable tracking of how data representations affect computational outcomes through formal decision-valued maps and persistent storage.

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

### [39] [The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: A Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture for Securing Enterprise AI Estates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
*John M. Willis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PBSAI introduces a multi-agent reference architecture for securing enterprise AI estates, organizing responsibilities into 12 domains with bounded agent families, context envelopes, and structured output contracts to provide implementable security for complex AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI governance frameworks (like NIST AI RMF) provide principles but lack implementable architectures for securing complex, multi-agent AI systems deployed in enterprise environments. As enterprises deploy LLMs, RAG pipelines, and tool-using agents on shared infrastructure, there's a need for practical security architectures for these "AI estates" - socio-technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, and infrastructure.

Method: The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem organizes security responsibilities into a 12-domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. It includes a lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem-level invariants to ensure traceability, provenance, and human-in-the-loop guarantees.

Result: The architecture demonstrates alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and shows applicability in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. It provides a structured foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Conclusion: PBSAI offers a practical, implementable reference architecture for securing complex AI estates, addressing the gap between existing governance principles and actual deployment needs in enterprise environments with multi-agent AI systems.

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

TL;DR: Systematic review critiques the "ground truth" paradigm in ML, revealing how consensus-seeking annotation practices suppress human disagreement, impose Western norms, and propose pluralistic annotation infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the positivistic fallacy in machine learning that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than valuable sociotechnical signal, and investigates how current data annotation practices create a "consensus trap" that suppresses diverse perspectives.

Method: Systematic literature review of 30,897 records from 2017 premier venues (ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, NeurIPS) between 2020-2025, refined to 346 papers for qualitative synthesis using reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Reveals systemic failures in positional legibility, anchoring bias from model-mediated annotations, geographic hegemony imposing Western norms, and performative alignment of precarious data workers prioritizing compliance over honest subjectivity.

Conclusion: Proposes shifting from consensus-seeking to pluralistic annotation infrastructures that map diversity of human experience rather than seeking singular "right" answers, reclaiming disagreement as essential signal for culturally competent models.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLPO is a bi-level prompt optimization framework that improves multimodal LLM judges for evaluating AI-generated images by converting images to text representations and jointly optimizing both judge and image-to-text prompts within context window constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as automated judges for AI-generated content evaluation, but aligning them with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning is costly and inflexible, and existing auto prompt optimization methods focus on text-only evaluations, there's a need for efficient prompt optimization in multimodal settings, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images where context window constraints limit visual example processing.

Method: Proposes BLPO (Bi-Level Prompt Optimization), a framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Uses bi-level optimization to jointly refine the judge prompt and the image-to-text (I2T) prompt, enabling effective trial-and-error prompt refinement within limited context budgets for multimodal LLM judges.

Result: Experiments conducted on four datasets with three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of BLPO in improving multimodal LLM-based evaluation of AI-generated images.

Conclusion: BLPO addresses the key bottleneck in multimodal prompt optimization by enabling efficient refinement of LLM judges for image evaluation through bi-level optimization of prompts and image-to-text conversion, overcoming context window limitations while maintaining visual fidelity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: AgentNoiseBench is a framework for evaluating LLM-based agent robustness under realistic noisy environments, categorizing noise into user-noise and tool-noise, and revealing performance sensitivity to environmental perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents perform well on benchmarks but degrade in real-world deployments due to stochasticity and noise that existing training/evaluation paradigms overlook. There's a need to bridge this gap between idealized benchmark performance and real-world robustness.

Method: 1) Conducted analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios to categorize environmental noise into user-noise and tool-noise. 2) Developed automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. 3) Performed extensive evaluations across diverse models with various architectures and parameter scales.

Result: The framework reveals consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations. Performance degradation occurs in noisy environments compared to idealized benchmark settings.

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench provides a systematic approach to evaluate agent robustness under realistic noisy conditions, addressing the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment. The findings emphasize the need for more robust agentic models that can handle environmental noise.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

TL;DR: BAO is an agentic RL framework that balances task performance with user engagement by combining behavior enhancement for proactive reasoning and behavior regularization to suppress inefficient interactions, outperforming baselines on UserRL benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive LLM agent training pipelines struggle to balance task performance with user engagement - passive agents can't adapt to user intentions while excessive human feedback reduces satisfaction, creating a critical trade-off.

Method: BAO combines behavior enhancement (enriching proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities) with behavior regularization (suppressing inefficient/redundant interactions and aligning agent behavior with user expectations) within an agentic RL framework.

Result: BAO substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines and achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLM agents on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite.

Conclusion: BAO effectively trains proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios by addressing the performance-engagement trade-off through combined behavior enhancement and regularization.

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

TL;DR: ReplicatorBench: A benchmark for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by including both replicable and non-replicable claims and focusing on the replication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agents in scientific paper assessment focus primarily on computational reproduction with code/data access, failing to capture real-world challenges like inconsistent data availability, lack of ground-truth diversity (only reproducible papers), and insufficient evaluation of the replication process itself.

Method: Introduces ReplicatorBench with human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims from social/behavioral sciences, evaluating AI agents across three stages: (1) extraction/retrieval of replication data, (2) design/execution of computational experiments, (3) interpretation of results. Also develops ReplicatorAgent framework with tools (web search, sandboxed environments) as baseline.

Result: Evaluation across four LLMs shows current LLM agents can effectively design/execute computational experiments but struggle with retrieving necessary resources (like new data) for replication. Performance varies with programming language and code access levels.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench provides comprehensive evaluation of AI agents in research replication, revealing current limitations in resource retrieval while demonstrating capabilities in experimental design/execution. The benchmark addresses gaps in existing evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

*Heejeong Nam,Quentin Le Lidec,Lucas Maes,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: C-JEPA extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations, using object-level masking to force interaction reasoning and induce causal inductive bias, improving visual question answering and enabling efficient planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric representations alone are insufficient for capturing interaction-dependent dynamics in world models; robust relational understanding is needed for prediction, reasoning, and control.

Method: C-JEPA applies object-level masking to object-centric representations, requiring an object's state to be inferred from other objects, which induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions.

Result: C-JEPA achieves ~20% absolute improvement in counterfactual reasoning on visual question answering compared to architectures without object-level masking, and enables substantially more efficient planning using only 1% of latent input features while matching patch-based world model performance.

Conclusion: Object-level masking in object-centric world models induces causal inductive bias via latent interventions, making interaction reasoning essential and leading to improved relational understanding for prediction, reasoning, and control tasks.

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

*Michael Menezes,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a structured pruning framework for Mamba2 that reduces state dimension by 50% with minimal perplexity degradation, using forward-pass statistics to approximate control-theoretic balanced truncation without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2's expanded state dimension improves temporal modeling but creates substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods are prohibitively expensive.

Method: GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation) is a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. It jointly measures controllability and observability to identify which state dimensions contribute least to input-output behavior, enabling structured pruning without requiring backpropagation.

Result: On models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, GHOST achieves a 50% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2, rivaling the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an effective structured pruning solution for Mamba2 models that addresses inference bandwidth bottlenecks while maintaining model quality, offering a practical approach to reduce computational overhead without expensive gradient computations.

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACER is a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for AI agents in multi-turn tool-using interactions that detects critical failure episodes by combining content-aware surprisal, situational awareness signals, repetition patterns, and tool coherence gaps using a tail-focused risk functional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and miss trajectory-level breakdown signals in real-world multi-turn tool-using interactions, where failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes like looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination.

Method: TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, aggregating them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies in agent trajectories.

Result: TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines on the τ²-bench for predicting task failure and selective task execution, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: TRACER effectively addresses the limitations of single-shot uncertainty metrics by providing trajectory-level uncertainty estimation that captures critical failure episodes in multi-turn tool-using interactions, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

*Chengrui Qu,Christopher Yeh,Kishan Panaganti,Eric Mazumdar,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributionally Robust IGM (DrIGM), a robust version of the IGM principle for multi-agent RL that ensures decentralized greedy actions align with robust team-optimal joint actions under environmental uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods in multi-agent RL rely on the IGM principle, but their reliability in real-world settings is compromised by environmental uncertainties like sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise.

Method: Proposes Distributionally Robust IGM (DrIGM) principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with robust team-optimal joint action. Derives DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that train on robust Q-targets while preserving scalability and seamless integration with existing codebases.

Result: The methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and StarCraft game environment, demonstrating enhanced robustness to environmental uncertainties without requiring bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

Conclusion: DrIGM provides a principled framework for robust multi-agent RL that maintains the benefits of CTDE while offering provable robustness guarantees against environmental uncertainties, enabling more reliable deployment in real-world settings.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AT-RL selectively reinforces high-connectivity visual-textual anchor tokens via graph clustering, achieving superior performance with minimal overhead by focusing credit assignment on critical multimodal grounding points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RLVR for MLLMs, the mechanism of visual evidence integration during reasoning remains poorly understood, particularly how cross-modal attention connectivity influences multimodal reasoning quality.

Method: Analyze multimodal RLVR through cross-modal attention connectivity, identify high-connectivity anchor tokens (~15%), propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL) that selectively reinforces these tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology.

Result: AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables 32B model to surpass 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains across STEM, video, and general tasks. Training on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation.

Conclusion: Reasoning quality in multimodal RL is governed not by token quantity but by fidelity of cross-modal anchoring; effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchor tokens.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

*Faouzi El Yagoubi,Ranwa Al Mallah,Godwin Badu-Marfo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak is the first full-stack benchmark for measuring privacy leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, revealing that internal channels (inter-agent messages) leak significantly more sensitive data than external outputs, with output-only audits missing 41.7% of violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks for LLMs only measure output leakage, but multi-agent systems create additional privacy risks through internal channels like inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments that are never inspected by output-only audits.

Method: Developed AgentLeak benchmark with 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, featuring a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Tested GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces, analyzing leakage across multiple channels (C1: output, C2: inter-agent messages, C5: other internal channels).

Result: Multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% single-agent) but increase total system exposure to 68.9% due to internal channels. Inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8% vs 27.2% on C1, meaning output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet had lowest leakage (3.3% external, 28.1% internal). Pattern C2 > C1 held consistently across all models and domains.

Conclusion: Inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability in multi-agent LLM systems, requiring coordination frameworks with internal-channel privacy protections and privacy controls on inter-agent communication. Model-level safety training may help protect internal channels.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches focus on task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations but overlook continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves, which is crucial for sustained adaptation in dynamic environments.

Method: Human-inspired continuous learning framework unifying reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. Systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material to optimize reasoning organization, scheduling, and evolution. Supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism.

Result: Experimental results on temperature sensor abnormality detection show 23.9% reduction in average runtime when incorporating internal-process learning.

Conclusion: The framework enables AI systems to progressively evolve their internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability, representing a significant advancement toward more adaptive and efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Motivation: Traditional causal analysis requires dual expertise in statistics and computer science, manual algorithm selection, data quality handling, and complex result interpretation, creating significant technical barriers for researchers.

Method: Integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate the entire causal inference workflow from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction.

Result: Users can upload datasets and ask questions in natural language to receive rigorous, interactive analysis reports with visualizations, significantly lowering the barrier to entry while maintaining process rigor and interpretability.

Conclusion: CausalAgent represents a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm that explicitly models the analysis workflow, making causal inference more accessible while ensuring methodological rigor.

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

*Hanbing Liu,Chunhao Tian,Nan An,Ziyuan Wang,Pinyan Lu,Changyuan Yu,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: INTENT is an inference-time planning framework for budget-constrained tool-augmented LLM agents that uses intention-aware hierarchical world modeling to anticipate tool usage and costs, enabling strict budget adherence while improving task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need to solve multi-step tasks using external tools under strict monetary budgets, but direct planning is intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high outcome variance, and prohibitive exploration costs in this sequential decision-making context.

Method: INTENT uses an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage and risk-calibrated costs, enabling inference-time planning that guides decisions online while strictly enforcing hard budget constraints.

Result: On cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts like tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: INTENT provides an effective inference-time planning solution for budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, addressing the challenges of massive state spaces and stochastic tool executions while maintaining strict budget adherence and robustness to market dynamics.

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

*Zhenlin Qin,Yancheng Ling,Leizhen Wang,Francisco Câmara Pereira,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN integrates LLMs with generative modeling for semantic-statistical population synthesis, achieving improved alignment with target distributions while maintaining feasibility and diversity through semantic persona conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population synthesis approaches focus on structured attributes and statistical constraints but lack semantic-conditioned generation that captures abstract behavioral patterns implicit in survey data, creating a gap in joint representation of statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics.

Method: Proposes SemaPop framework that derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records using LLMs, incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals, and uses marginal regularization to enforce alignment with target population marginals. Instantiated with WGAN-GP backbone (SemaPop-GAN).

Result: SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance with closer alignment to target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies confirm semantic persona conditioning and architectural choices contribute to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion, providing a modular foundation for generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

*Aditya Taparia,Som Sagar,Ransalu Senanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARC learns hierarchical RL policies to dynamically configure LLM-based agents per query, outperforming fixed templates and reducing compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent systems use fixed templates or hand-tuned heuristics for configuration, leading to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute costs since the same configuration is applied to both easy and hard queries.

Method: Formulates agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduces ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor configurations (workflows, tools, token budgets, prompts).

Result: Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Conclusion: Learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs, demonstrating that dynamic configuration optimization can significantly improve both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

### [56] [The Five Ws of Multi-Agent Communication: Who Talks to Whom, When, What, and Why -- A Survey from MARL to Emergent Language and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11583)
*Jingdi Chen,Hanqing Yang,Zongjun Liu,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing multi-agent communication through the Five Ws framework, tracing evolution across MARL, Emergent Language, and LLM-based paradigms, highlighting trade-offs and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems in dynamic, partially observable environments require communication to reduce uncertainty and enable collaboration. Existing research lacks a unified framework to connect disparate approaches across different paradigms.

Method: Uses the Five Ws framework (who, what, when, why) to analyze multi-agent communication. Surveys evolution across three paradigms: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Emergent Language (EL), and LLM-based systems. Identifies design patterns, trade-offs, and connections between approaches.

Result: Provides systematic analysis showing: MARL methods evolved from hand-designed to learned communication but lack interpretability; EL methods develop structured communication but struggle with grounding and scalability; LLMs bring natural language priors for open-ended collaboration but face integration challenges. Identifies practical design patterns and main trade-offs across paradigms.

Conclusion: Future hybrid systems should combine learning, language, and control for scalable, interpretable multi-agent collaboration. Key open challenges include grounding emergent communication, improving generalization, and integrating LLM reasoning with control systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

*Nikhil Verma,Minjung Kim,JooYoung Yoo,Kyung-Min Jin,Manasa Bharadwaj,Kevin Ferreira,Ko Keun Kim,Youngjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces modality-aware RL post-training with benchmark annotation of minimal signal requirements, policy optimization stratifying by modality needs, and adaptive curriculum to reduce gradient variance and improve convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL post-training treats all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind approach inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted.

Method: MAPLE comprises: (1) MAPLE-bench benchmark annotating minimal signal combinations per task; (2) MAPO modality-aware policy optimization that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations.

Result: MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. Systematic analysis establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy.

Conclusion: MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training by addressing modality-blind training limitations through explicit modality requirement annotation, stratified optimization, and adaptive curriculum design.

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

*Yiming Gao,Zhen Wang,Jefferson Chen,Mark Antkowiak,Mengzhou Hu,JungHo Kong,Dexter Pratt,Jieyuan Liu,Enze Ma,Zhiting Hu,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scPilot is the first framework enabling LLMs to perform omics-native reasoning by directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and using bioinformatics tools for step-by-step analysis of cell-type annotation, trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack direct grounding in raw omics data, limiting their ability to perform transparent, interpretable single-cell analyses with proper justification and revision capabilities based on evidence.

Method: scPilot converts core single-cell analyses into step-by-step reasoning problems where LLMs converse in natural language while directly inspecting scRNA-seq data and using on-demand bioinformatics tools, generating transparent reasoning traces.

Result: Iterative omics-native reasoning improves average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation (o1 model), Gemini-2.5-Pro reduces trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, and the framework generates explainable reasoning traces for marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic.

Conclusion: By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses, with scBench providing comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for omics-native reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

### [59] [When Agents Disagree With Themselves: Measuring Behavioral Consistency in LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11619)
*Aman Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents exhibit significant behavioral inconsistency across identical task runs, with variance predicting failure rates - consistent agents achieve 80-92% accuracy while inconsistent ones only 25-60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents produce consistent behavior when running the same task multiple times with identical inputs, and to understand the relationship between behavioral consistency and task success rates.

Method: Conducted 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA using ReAct-style agents, analyzing action sequence variance and its correlation with accuracy.

Result: Agents produce 2.0-4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average; tasks with consistent behavior (≤2 unique paths) achieve 80-92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks (≥6 unique paths) achieve only 25-60% accuracy, showing a 32-55 percentage point gap. 69% of divergence occurs at step 2 (first search query).

Conclusion: Behavioral inconsistency in LLM agents predicts failure, with early decisions (particularly at step 2) being critical divergence points. Monitoring consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

*Yipeng Huang,Dejun Xu,Zexin Lin,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NMIPS is a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver that discovers analytical solutions for PDE families using multifactorial optimization and affine transfer, achieving ~35.7% accuracy improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods require solving each PDE instance independently, incurring massive computational cost, while machine learning PDE solvers lack interpretability due to their black-box nature and only provide numerical approximations rather than analytical expressions needed for scientific insight.

Method: Proposes NMIPS framework using multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover analytical solutions for PDE families. Introduces affine transfer method to transfer learned mathematical structures among related PDEs, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch and enhancing computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to ~35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: NMIPS addresses limitations of both traditional numerical methods and machine learning PDE solvers by providing computationally efficient discovery of interpretable analytical solutions for PDE families through neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic solving.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

TL;DR: MathSpatial is a framework for evaluating and improving mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs, addressing their poor performance on spatial reasoning tasks compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on mathematical spatial reasoning tasks (below 60% accuracy) while humans achieve over 95% accuracy, revealing a fundamental weakness in current models that needs investigation.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) MathSpatial-Bench benchmark with 2K problems across 3 categories and 11 subtypes, (2) MathSpatial-Corpus training dataset with 8K verified problems, and (3) MathSpatial-SRT modeling reasoning as structured traces with three atomic operations (Correlate, Constrain, Infer).

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25%, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm addressing RL limitations in medical QA by decomposing alignment into four categories with closed-loop supervision and unified optimization with scale alignment and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL paradigms (RLHF and RL from verifiable rewards) are mismatched for medical QA due to expensive preference annotations, lack of effective automatic verifiers, and inability to handle complex clinical contexts while simultaneously optimizing correctness, safety, and compliance with heterogeneous reward signals.

Method: 1) Constructs holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix decomposing objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. 2) Establishes closed-loop system where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis driving optimizable rewards. 3) Implements unified optimization with Reference-Frozen Normalization for scale alignment and Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting for collaborative optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

Conclusion: Proposes a robust medical alignment paradigm that addresses limitations of current RL approaches through decomposed alignment objectives, closed-loop supervision, and unified optimization mechanisms, providing a new framework for complex alignment in specialized domains like medicine.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

*E Fan,Lisong Shi,Zhengtong Li,Chih-yung Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE is a neurosymbolic agentic framework that decouples neural planning from symbolic validation to address the semantic-physical disconnect in LLM-based CFD automation, achieving 96% relative improvement over baselines while reducing self-correction loops by 59% and token consumption by 17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents for CFD suffer from probabilistic nature that cannot enforce strict conservation laws and numerical stability, leading to physically invalid configurations due to semantic-physical disconnect and context poisoning in standard RAG approaches.

Method: PhyNiKCE employs a neurosymbolic architecture with decoupled neural planning and symbolic validation. It features a Symbolic Knowledge Engine treating simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, and a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions to rigidly enforce physical constraints.

Result: Validated through OpenFOAM experiments on practical CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrated 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59%, and lowered LLM token consumption by 17%.

Conclusion: Decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency in physics-based simulations. While validated on CFD, the architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy AI in broader industrial automation.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

*Longyuan Zhu,Hairan Hua,Linlin Miao,Bing Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a data-driven framework for auditing LLM evaluation benchmarks across three axes: capability discrimination, anti-saturation, and impact, addressing benchmark reliability issues in AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM benchmarks are becoming unreliable due to score inflation and selective reporting, eroding trust in evaluation results and leaving the community uncertain about which benchmarks remain authoritative.

Method: BHI framework evaluates benchmarks along three orthogonal axes: (1) Capability Discrimination - measures how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation - estimates remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution; (3) Impact - quantifies influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. The framework analyzes 106 validated benchmarks from technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025.

Result: BHI provides the first framework to systematically characterize the evaluation landscape at a macro level, enabling principled benchmark selection and dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: BHI addresses the critical need for reliable benchmark assessment in LLM evaluation, offering a data-driven approach to quantify benchmark health and restore trust in evaluation metrics through systematic auditing of evaluation sets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

### [65] [Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11675)
*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Rung Collapse as a causal pathology in autoregressive training where models fail to distinguish association from intervention, leading to Aleatoric Entrenchment where correct answers reinforce flawed causal reasoning. The authors propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM) as a belief revision objective with theoretical guarantees and demonstrate its effectiveness in recovering entrenched errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often achieve high performance through shortcuts that fail under distributional shift. The paper aims to address the fundamental causal pathology where autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish between association P(Y|X) and intervention P(Y|do(X)), leading to models that are "right for the wrong reasons" and become entrenched in flawed reasoning.

Method: The authors propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success. They embed this within a three-layer architecture with three key contributions: (1) Physical Grounding Theorem proving actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors with domain-independent guards for cross-domain transfer.

Result: Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs show that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2). The study reveals that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, while targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails. The authors prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds.

Conclusion: The paper successfully identifies and addresses the fundamental problem of Rung Collapse in autoregressive training, providing both theoretical foundations and practical solutions through Epistemic Regret Minimization. The approach bridges causal reasoning with knowledge representation, offering a principled method to prevent models from becoming entrenched in flawed causal reasoning even when they produce correct answers.

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR is a scalable preflight planning method for large UAV fleets in dynamic airspace that uses prioritized planning with iterative conflict resolution, achieving near-100% success for up to 1,000 UAVs with 50% runtime reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPF methods lack scalability and flexibility for real-world UTM applications with temporal NFZs, heterogeneous UAVs, and strict delivery deadlines in dynamic shared airspace.

Method: Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution (DTAPP-IICR): 1) Initial solution generation by mission urgency prioritization, 2) Roundtrip trajectory computation using SFIPP-ST (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints) for heterogeneous UAVs with temporal NFZs, 3) Iterative Large Neighborhood Search guided by geometric conflict graph for residual conflict resolution, 4) Completeness-preserving directional pruning for 3D search acceleration.

Result: Achieves near-100% success rate for fleets up to 1,000 UAVs, gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforms batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search, and scales successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail.

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR provides a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace, addressing the limitations of existing MAPF methods for UTM applications.

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

TL;DR: V2G pipeline converts CAD diagrams to property graphs to address MLLMs' structural blindness in engineering schematics, achieving large accuracy gains on electrical compliance checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from structural blindness - they fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics because their pixel-driven paradigm discards explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning.

Method: Proposed Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable.

Result: On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level.

Conclusion: Structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains, highlighting the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods for structural reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

### [68] [ThinkRouter: Efficient Reasoning via Routing Thinking between Latent and Discrete Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11683)
*Xin Xu,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Haoliang Wang,Julian McAuley,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically switches between explicit token-based reasoning and latent reasoning based on model confidence levels, improving accuracy and efficiency in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in latent reasoning approaches where effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis reveals that incorrect reasoning trajectories often contain fewer low-confidence steps than correct ones, and soft embeddings from multiple low-confidence alternatives can introduce noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning. This motivates the need for a mechanism to avoid high confidence and noise in reasoning processes.

Method: ThinkRouter is an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically routes thinking processes: when model confidence is low, it routes to discrete token space (explicit reasoning); when confidence is high, it routes to latent space (continuous representations). This selective routing aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their weaknesses.

Result: Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models show ThinkRouter outperforms explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), random routing, and latent reasoning baselines. It achieves an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1 while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. The mechanism effectively calibrates errors from both explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Conclusion: ThinkRouter successfully addresses the limitations of both explicit and latent reasoning approaches by introducing a confidence-aware routing mechanism that dynamically selects the appropriate reasoning modality. This approach improves reasoning accuracy while reducing computational overhead, demonstrating the value of adaptive inference-time routing strategies for efficient reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

TL;DR: SCF-RKL is a novel model merging framework that uses sparse, distribution-aware updates with reverse KL divergence to reduce functional interference and improve merging performance across various model scales and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods rely on parameter-space heuristics that cause severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors like repetition and incoherent outputs.

Method: SCF-RKL uses reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure functional divergence between models and selectively incorporates complementary parameters through sparse, distribution-aware updates, avoiding the assumption of linear additivity in parameter space.

Result: Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks across reasoning, knowledge, instruction following, safety, and vision classification show SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Conclusion: SCF-RKL provides an effective framework for model merging that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse complementary fusion, enabling better integration of specialized models without costly retraining.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

*Thomas Jiralerspong,Trenton Bricken*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First application of crosscoders for cross-architecture model diffing with new Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) to identify safety-critical behaviors like political alignment and copyright refusal mechanisms in various LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model diffing methods are limited to comparing base models with their finetunes, but new LLM releases often involve novel architectures, necessitating cross-architecture methods for wider applicability in identifying safety-critical behaviors.

Method: Introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs) as an architectural modification to better isolate features unique to one model, enabling unsupervised cross-architecture model diffing using crosscoders for the first time.

Result: Successfully identified Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B through unsupervised feature discovery.

Conclusion: Establishes cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models, advancing the field beyond base vs finetune comparisons.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text2GQL-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for Text-to-GQL systems featuring 178K question-query pairs across 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework and multi-faceted evaluation metrics revealing significant dialect gaps in ISO-GQL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-GQL datasets are limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, and evaluation scope, hindering systematic advancement of these systems. There's a lack of high-quality benchmarks to compare model capabilities across different GQLs and domains.

Method: Created Text2GQL-Bench with a multi-GQL dataset of 178,184 question-query pairs spanning 13 domains, using a scalable construction framework that generates datasets across different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. Introduced comprehensive evaluation method assessing grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy.

Result: Revealed stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: strong LLMs achieve only ≤4% execution accuracy zero-shot, but 3-shot prompting raises to ~50% (though grammatical validity <70%). Fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% execution accuracy and 90.8% grammatical validity, showing most performance improvement comes from exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

Conclusion: Text2GQL-Bench addresses critical limitations in Text-to-GQL benchmarking, enabling systematic evaluation across domains and GQLs. The findings highlight the importance of dialect-specific training data and reveal that current LLMs struggle with ISO-GQL generation without sufficient exposure to examples, suggesting need for specialized training approaches.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

*Zibo Xiao,Jun Sun,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIR is the first incident response framework for LLM agents that autonomously manages detection, containment, recovery, and rule synthesis to improve safety through post-failure response mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent safety mechanisms focus only on preventing failures in advance, lacking capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably occur, creating a critical safety gap.

Method: AIR introduces a domain-specific language for managing incident response lifecycle autonomously, integrated into agent execution loops to: (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in environment state and context, (2) guide agents to execute containment/recovery actions via tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar future incidents.

Result: AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90% across three representative agent types. LLM-generated rules approach effectiveness of developer-authored rules, with experiments confirming design necessity, showing timeliness and moderate overhead.

Conclusion: Incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving LLM agent safety, addressing the critical gap in post-failure response capabilities that current prevention-only approaches cannot handle.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Farhan Ahmed,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts) is a training-time method that applies search techniques (like best-of-N, beam search) during rollout generation to improve multi-turn RL agent training, achieving better performance and stability without changing the optimization objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL for LLM agents faces challenges with sparse/delayed rewards and stochastic environments. Naive trajectory sampling can lead to poor exploitation and mode collapse, limiting agent performance in interactive tasks.

Method: TSR performs lightweight tree-style search during training rollouts to construct high-quality trajectories. It selects high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback, with instantiations including best-of-N, beam search, and shallow lookahead search. The approach is optimizer-agnostic and leaves the underlying RL objective unchanged.

Result: TSR achieves up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks. The method requires only a one-time increase in training compute while maintaining compatibility with existing RL frameworks like PPO and GRPO.

Conclusion: TSR provides a simple, general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning by moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training. It complements existing frameworks and rejection-sampling methods, offering improved performance without fundamental changes to RL optimization.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: MaxExp is a decision-driven framework for binarizing species distribution model predictions by maximizing evaluation metrics, with SSE as a computationally efficient alternative based on expected species richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current binarization methods for SDM predictions are heuristic and distort species prevalence and community composition estimates, creating a need for more robust, metric-driven approaches.

Method: MaxExp framework selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing chosen evaluation metrics without calibration data. SSE method predicts assemblages based on expected species richness as a computationally efficient alternative.

Result: MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods across diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers simpler but competitive performance.

Conclusion: MaxExp and SSE provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization that improve ecological inference and conservation planning by reducing distortion in species prevalence and community composition estimates.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE is a reinforcement learning framework that unifies ad text generation and performance alignment in a single end-to-end model, improving conversion metrics while maintaining policy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing industrial ad systems use a two-stage paradigm (generation then alignment) that causes misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.

Method: RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into generation via policy learning, using conversion-oriented metrics and compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards in a reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets show RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Online deployment yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) under strict policy constraints.

Conclusion: RELATE demonstrates robust real-world effectiveness by unifying generation and alignment, enabling production of high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance while maintaining policy compliance.

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Method: Execute-Summarize (ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness.

Result: Introduced FlowBench and showed through extensive experiments that the ES approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Conclusion: The Execute-Summarize framework offers an effective solution for accurately translating LLM task solutions into structured workflows by decoupling execution from construction, demonstrating superior performance over integrated approaches.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes.

*Lingyong Yan,Jiulong Wu,Dong Xie,Weixian Shi,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAVES is a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system that generates high-quality instructional videos from educational problems through specialized agents coordinated by an Orchestrating Agent, using structured executable scripts rather than direct pixel synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end video generation models lack logical rigor and precise knowledge representation needed for instructional/educational content, with limitations in procedural fidelity, high production costs, and limited controllability.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent system with Orchestrating Agent coordinating specialized agents: Solution Agent for problem solving, Illustration Agent for visualization codes, and Narration Agent for instructional scripts. Uses quality gates, iterative critique mechanisms, semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Generates structured executable video scripts compiled into synchronized visuals/narration via template-driven assembly.

Result: Achieves throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivers over 95% cost reduction compared to industry-standard approaches while maintaining high acceptance rate.

Conclusion: LAVES addresses limitations of prior video generation approaches by decomposing educational video creation into specialized tasks with quality controls, enabling automated, scalable, cost-effective production of logically rigorous instructional content.

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

*Hongbo Zhang,Yue Yang,Jianhao Yan,Guangsheng Bao,Yue Zhang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-kNN Distance is a black-box detection method that identifies RLVR contamination by measuring reduced generation diversity in RL-trained models, outperforming existing detection baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training creates benchmark contamination concerns because it fine-tunes models using reward feedback rather than token-level probabilities, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods ineffective. There's a need for reliable detection of RL contamination without access to reference models or token probabilities.

Method: Min-kNN Distance detector samples multiple completions for a given prompt and computes the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. This quantifies the behavioral signature where RLVR training causes prompts encountered during training to produce more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts maintain greater diversity.

Result: Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Conclusion: RLVR training induces a distinctive behavioral signature of reduced generation diversity that can be effectively detected using the simple black-box Min-kNN Distance method, providing a practical solution for identifying RL contamination without requiring access to model internals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

*Pingjun Pan,Tingting Zhou,Peiyao Lu,Tingting Fei,Hongxiang Chen,Chuanjiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM: Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal recommendation framework addressing suboptimal tokenization and architecture-data mismatch through disentangled semantic tokenization and hierarchical memory-anchor transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal recommendation approaches using semantic IDs face two key challenges: (1) suboptimal tokenization where methods like RQ-VAE lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) architecture-data mismatch where vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchical structure of user interactions, items, and tokens, leading to attention bias toward local details over holistic semantics.

Method: Two main components: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST) that unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via coarse-to-fine strategy, using shared codebooks for consensus distillation and modality-specific codebooks for nuance recovery from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT) that splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy, and inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for current item while accessing history through compressed summaries.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployment on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Conclusion: Hi-SAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing semantic ID-based multi-modal recommendation by introducing disentangled tokenization and hierarchical transformer architecture, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both offline experiments and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

*Lianjun Wu,Shengchen Zhu,Yuxuan Liu,Liuyu Kai,Xiaoduan Feng,Duomin Wang,Wenshuo Liu,Jingxuan Zhang,Kelvin Li,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuYun-LDM improves weather forecasting by enhancing latent diffusion model diffusability using 3D-MAE for weather-state conditioning and variable-aware spectral regularization to address meteorological data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models struggle with limited diffusability in high-resolution ensemble weather forecasting due to: 1) lack of task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures in meteorological fields (unlike natural images), making VFM-based regularization inapplicable; 2) existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under homogeneity assumptions, which fails to account for inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data.

Method: Proposes PuYun-LDM with two key components: 1) 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as additional conditioning for the diffusion model; 2) Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable, providing tailored regularization per meteorological variable.

Result: PuYun-LDM enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble) at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. The system generates a 15-day global forecast with 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, with ensemble forecasts efficiently produced in parallel.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-MAE conditioning and variable-aware spectral regularization effectively address the diffusability limitations of LDMs in high-resolution weather forecasting, enabling efficient and accurate ensemble predictions while accounting for the unique spectral heterogeneity of meteorological variables.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

*Huanyi Xie,Yubin Chen,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lightweight framework reuses LLM hidden states for efficient sequence length prediction, reducing padding waste in batched inference through entropy-guided pooling and progressive prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and RL sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods using auxiliary models have high overhead, poor generalization, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios.

Method: Introduces a lightweight framework with two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP) uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for accurate static prediction with negligible cost; 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP) dynamically estimates remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. Built ForeLen benchmark for evaluation.

Result: EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ForeLen benchmark, reducing MAE by 29.16% over best baseline. Integration with length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference by reusing main model's internal hidden states for length prediction, addressing computational waste from padding in batched inference.

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

*Jialin Wu,Wei Shi,Han Shen,Peigui Qi,Kunsheng Tang,Zhicong Huang,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REVIS is a training-free framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through orthogonal projection and sparse intervention in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from object hallucination due to visual features becoming intertwined with pretrained textual representations in deeper network layers, suppressing crucial visual information.

Method: REVIS uses orthogonal projection in latent space to extract pure visual information vectors, then performs calibrated sparse intervention only at the precise depth where visual suppression occurs, without requiring additional training.

Result: REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving general reasoning capabilities, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The training-free REVIS framework effectively addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by reactivating suppressed visual information through precise geometric interventions in latent space.

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT is a prototype-based transformer architecture that offers interpretable reasoning through learnable prototypes while maintaining competitive performance with linear sequence length scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive language models have opaque reasoning processes that undermine trust and introduce risks like deception and hallucination. There's a need for interpretable architectures that maintain performance while providing transparency.

Method: ProtoT replaces standard self-attention with prototype-based communication. It uses parameter vectors (prototypes) that engage in two-way communication with input sequences, automatically capturing nameable concepts during training. The architecture creates communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales.

Result: ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length (vs quadratic for standard transformers), performs well on text generation and GLUE tasks, shows robustness to input perturbations comparable to baselines, and provides interpretable pathways showing how robustness/sensitivity arises. Prototypes capture meaningful concepts like "woman" and enable targeted behavior edits.

Conclusion: ProtoT demonstrates that interpretable-by-design autoregressive language models can achieve near state-of-the-art performance while providing transparency into reasoning processes, paving the way for more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic map systems for vehicle-road-cloud cooperative autonomous driving lack natural-language-supported human interfaces, limiting human-DM interaction despite successful real-world deployments in Japan.

Method: Develop VRCsim simulation framework for generating streaming VRC cooperative perception data; construct VRC-QA dataset for spatial querying; propose Talk2DM plug-and-play module using chain-of-prompt mechanism integrating human-defined rules with LLM commonsense knowledge.

Result: Talk2DM achieves over 93% NLS query accuracy with 2-5 second response time across different LLMs (Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, GPT-oss), showing strong generalization; larger models have higher accuracy but efficiency degradation.

Conclusion: Talk2DM successfully extends VRC-DM systems with natural language querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities, demonstrating practical potential for enhancing human-DM interaction in cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics that cannot dynamically adapt to environmental changes or robustly handle unexpected failures, limiting AI agents' ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through meaningful collaboration with other AI agents and humans.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation as a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, incorporating transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between parties.

Result: The framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive delegation framework addresses limitations of current methods by incorporating comprehensive social and organizational dimensions, enabling more robust and effective collaboration between AI agents and humans in complex task environments.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSAE is a hierarchical sparse autoencoder that learns parent-child relationships between features to capture the hierarchical structure of concepts in LLMs, outperforming standard SAEs in recovering semantically meaningful hierarchies while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders extract monosemantic features from LLMs in isolation, but evidence suggests LLMs capture hierarchical language structure (e.g., feature splitting). Current methods fail to capture these hierarchical relationships between features.

Method: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) jointly learns a series of SAEs and parent-child relationships between their features using two novel mechanisms: structural constraint loss and random feature perturbation mechanism to strengthen parent-child alignment.

Result: HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies across various LLMs and layers, validated by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics, while preserving reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

Conclusion: HSAE provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations, advancing beyond isolated feature extraction to capture hierarchical semantic organization.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Abstraction (SA) framework enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by replacing uncertain content with higher-confidence abstractions rather than completely abstaining, improving factual accuracy while preserving information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to factual errors that limit adoption in high-risk settings. Current uncertainty estimation approaches use binary abstention, which is excessively restrictive in long-form generation, often discarding valuable information.

Method: Introduces Selective Abstraction (SA) framework formalized through selective risk and coverage. Proposes Atom-wise Selective Abstraction that decomposes responses into atomic claims and replaces uncertain atoms with higher-confidence, less specific abstractions. Develops end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation with factual correctness as risk measure and information-theoretic coverage measurement.

Result: Across six open-source models on FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving area under risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating improved accuracy and reliability while preserving original meaning.

Conclusion: Selective Abstraction provides a more nuanced approach than binary abstention, allowing LLMs to maintain reliability while preserving valuable information through specificity reduction, offering practical benefits for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE reframes alpha mining as strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), using Bayesian retrieval and DAG-aware generation to overcome limitations of existing decoupled and iterative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated alpha factor mining methods lack global structural view, treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, leading to redundant search and limited diversity. Decoupled Factor Generation treats factor discovery as isolated events, while Iterative Factor Evolution focuses only on local parent-child refinements.

Method: AlphaPROBE models factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges in a DAG. It consists of two core components: 1) Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through posterior probability model, and 2) DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. The DAG-based approach provides a more systematic framework for alpha factor mining compared to existing paradigms.

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

TL;DR: MEME is a novel framework that models financial markets as evolving ecosystems of investment narratives, using multi-agent extraction and Gaussian mixture modeling to identify consensus logics for portfolio construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods in quantitative finance either focus on individual stock prediction (Asset-Centric) or portfolio allocation (Market-Centric) without capturing the underlying reasoning driving market movements. There's a need to model financial markets as dynamic ecosystems of competing investment narratives to better understand market dynamics.

Method: MEME employs: 1) Multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments; 2) Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within semantic space; 3) Temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track lifecycle and historical profitability of investment modes; 4) Prioritizes enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies for robust portfolio construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023-2025 show MEME consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case studies, and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to evolving market consensus.

Conclusion: MEME successfully operationalizes a Logic-Oriented perspective of financial markets as evolutionary ecosystems of competing investment narratives, providing a framework that captures market dynamics through evolving logics and outperforms existing approaches in portfolio construction.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents are static or synchronous, lacking realistic asynchronous environments where environments evolve independently of agent actions. There's a need for evaluations that capture temporal constraints, dynamic events, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration challenges to better assess practical agent capabilities.

Each scenario includes a write-action verifier for fine-grained, action-level evaluation. Built on the open-source Agents Research Environments (ARE) platform using consumer environments, designed for extensibility.

Result: Evaluation shows no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) achieves strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks; Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy/speed for cost; Kimi-K2 leads open-source models with 21% pass@1. Results reveal trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness and expose sim2real gap challenges.

Conclusion: Gaia2 provides a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training practical agent systems. By releasing Gaia2 with the ARE framework, the authors aim to advance next-generation agent development and address fundamental challenges in agent evaluation and deployment.

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

TL;DR: CSEval is a framework using language models to evaluate clinical semantic alignment between generated medical images and their prompts, addressing limitations of existing metrics that focus only on realism/diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical text-to-image generation mainly assess image realism or diversity, but fail to capture whether generated images reflect intended clinical semantics like anatomical location and pathology. This gap is critical for safe adoption of generative models in healthcare applications.

Method: Proposes Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between generated images and their conditioning prompts. The approach evaluates whether generated images accurately reflect the intended clinical semantics described in the prompts.

Result: Experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. The framework provides a scalable and clinically meaningful evaluation method.

Conclusion: CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare by ensuring generated images accurately reflect intended clinical semantics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

*Xiuping Wu,Zhao Yu,Yuxin Cheng,Ngai Wong,Liangjun Ke,Tapas Mishra,Konstantinos V. Katsikopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two parameter-free optimization methods (InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt) that leverage behavioral patterns from LLMs' reasoning to enhance performance on reasoning tasks without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving LLM reasoning through behavior-related prompt adjustments are largely intuitive and lack systematic analysis of underlying behavioral patterns. The authors aim to investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from a behavioral pattern perspective.

Method: Two optimization methods: 1) InjectCorrect - guides models by imitating behavioral patterns from their own past correct answers; 2) InjectRLOpt - learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and uses a Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy to generate behavioral injectants during inference to steer reasoning.

Result: Both methods improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without parameter modifications, achieving gains of up to 5.34% (InjectCorrect) and 8.67% (InjectRLOpt).

Conclusion: Models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors for specific question types, and structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence reasoning quality. The proposed parameter-free optimization methods effectively leverage behavioral patterns to enhance LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

TL;DR: LawThinker is an autonomous legal research agent that uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with atomic verification after each knowledge exploration step to ensure procedurally compliant legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal reasoning methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors like inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain, compromising procedural compliance.

Method: LawThinker adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module that examines each retrieval result along three dimensions: knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, plus a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse.

Result: On the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL, LawThinker achieves 24% improvement over direct reasoning and 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. It also shows generalization capability on three static benchmarks.

Conclusion: LawThinker effectively addresses the procedural compliance gap in legal reasoning through atomic verification and demonstrates superior performance in dynamic judicial environments while maintaining generalization capability.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

### [94] [Differentiable Modal Logic for Multi-Agent Diagnosis, Orchestration and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12083)
*Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) enables learning of trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data in multi-agent AI systems, providing a neurosymbolic debugging framework for semantic failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent AI systems evolving from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms require debugging semantic failures involving knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation. Traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems, creating a need for automated learning approaches.

Method: Differentiable Modal Logic (DML) implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs) learns trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data. The framework operates through four modalities: epistemic (trust), temporal (causality), deontic (permissions), and doxastic (confidence interpretation).

Result: The approach enables interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, knowledge injection via differentiable axioms for sparse data learning, compositional multi-modal reasoning combining epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints, and practical deployment patterns for monitoring and controlling multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: DML provides a practical neurosymbolic debugging framework that transforms logical contradictions into learnable optimization objectives, enabling automated discovery of complex relationship structures in multi-agent AI systems from behavioral data alone.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

*Xiaoyuan Liu,Tian Liang,Dongyang Ma,Deyu Zhou,Haitao Mi,Pinjia He,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StateLM introduces a new class of foundation models with internal reasoning loops and memory tools, enabling active context management and stateful reasoning that significantly outperforms standard LLMs on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack agency to actively manage their own context/memory, remaining passive recipients of manually engineered context within fixed architectural windows, analogous to Dumbledore having a Pensieve but no wand to use it.

Method: Introduces StateLM with internal reasoning loop and memory tools (context pruning, document indexing, note-taking), training models to actively manage these tools and dynamically engineer their own context rather than being constrained by fixed windows.

Result: StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales on long-document QA; achieve 10-20% absolute accuracy improvements on chat memory tasks; and show dramatic 52% vs 5% performance gap on BrowseComp-Plus deep research tasks.

Conclusion: StateLM shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents with stateful, manageable reasoning processes, breaking free from architectural constraints of fixed context windows through active memory management.

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

### [96] [Stop Unnecessary Reflection: Training LRMs for Efficient Reasoning with Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12113)
*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARLCP is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in Large Reasoning Models by adaptively penalizing unnecessary reflections and coordinating length penalties based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate over-long chains-of-thought with excessive reflections (repetitive self-questioning, circular reasoning), leading to high token consumption, computational overhead, and latency without improving accuracy, especially in smaller models. Problem complexity exacerbates this issue, reducing accuracy while increasing token overhead.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a reinforcement learning framework with two key innovations: (1) reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) length penalty calibrated to estimated problem complexity. These coordinated penalties encourage more concise and effective reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluated on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and 7B models. For 1.5B model: 53.1% reduction in average response length with 5.8% accuracy improvement. For 7B model: 35.0% length reduction with 2.7% accuracy gain. Achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ARLCP effectively addresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in Large Reasoning Models by dynamically balancing reasoning efficiency through adaptive reflection and length penalties, enabling more concise and effective reasoning paths while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) with zero-shot priors outperform classical methods for short, sparse university enrollment forecasting when using leakage-safe covariates and a novel regime indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universities face financial pressure requiring accurate enrollment forecasts, but traditional methods struggle with short annual data series, reporting changes, and structural breaks that degrade extrapolation reliability.

Method: Benchmark multiple TSFM families in zero-shot setting using leakage-disciplined covariate construction, introduce Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI) regime covariate from documentary evidence, and Google Trends demand proxies with stabilizing feature engineering, tested via expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment.

Result: Covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance varying by cohort and model type.

Conclusion: TSFMs with zero-shot priors and carefully constructed leakage-safe covariates provide viable alternatives to classical methods for data-sparse institutional enrollment forecasting, particularly when incorporating regime information through transferable indicators like IOCI.

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

*Hanno Ackermann,Hong Cai,Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLA (Hadamard Linear Attention) is a new linear attention method that applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities, using higher-degree rational functions to better approximate softmax, with efficient computation suitable for large-scale applications like video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quadratic attention in transformers has high computational cost, while existing linear attention methods use low-degree rational approximations that apply nonlinearity separately to queries and keys before similarity computation, potentially limiting their approximation quality to softmax.

Method: HLA applies nonlinearity after computing pairwise similarities (analogous to standard softmax attention), using higher-degree rational functions to approximate softmax. It derives an efficient computational scheme similar to standard linear attention without requiring time-consuming tensor reshaping operations.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness when applied to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application involving very large amounts of tokens, showing practical utility for computationally intensive tasks.

Conclusion: HLA provides a more accurate approximation to softmax attention than previous linear attention methods while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale applications where standard quadratic attention would be prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study reveals strong demographic biases in commercial image generators (Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT Image 1.5) when using neutral prompts, showing "default white" bias (>96%) and divergent gender preferences, challenging assumptions about neutral language producing inclusive representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs in commercial image generators, and to quantify gender and skin-tone biases in widely deployed AI models.

Method: Generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts across two models. Employed rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales.

Result: Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults: both models exhibited strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs), but diverged sharply on gender - Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones.

Conclusion: Neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions, revealing underlying biases in AI models. The study provides a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing value alignment work characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions (prompting, fine-tuning, preference optimization) reshape the broader value system. There's a need to understand the dynamic propagation of alignment-induced changes across interconnected values.

Method: Introduce Value Alignment Tax (VAT) framework measuring alignment-induced changes relative to on-target gain. Use controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, collect paired pre-post normative judgments, and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies.

Result: Alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks.

Conclusion: The VAT framework offers new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs by capturing how alignment pressure reshapes value expression across interconnected value systems, highlighting previously invisible systemic risks.

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive large model evaluation is prohibitively expensive, and existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable.

Method: STAR combines data-driven statistical expectations with knowledge-driven agentic reasoning. It uses specialized retrievers for external knowledge, embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) for statistical expectations with uncertainty, and employs a reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) for refinement through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation.

Result: STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, achieving a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity (only 1-2 observed scores per test model).

Conclusion: The STAR framework effectively bridges statistical and knowledge-driven approaches to predict model performance from limited observations, providing traceable explanations and robust performance even under extreme data sparsity conditions.

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

TL;DR: Novel lossless compression method using Reinforcement Learning with T5 architecture to compress data into token sequences rather than vector representations, achieving higher compression ratios while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression techniques struggle with complex data structures, and deep learning approaches often use dense vector representations that obscure token structure. There's a need for compression methods that preserve the original data format while achieving better compression ratios.

Method: Reinforcement Learning applied to T5 language model architecture to compress data into token sequences. Uses off-policy RL algorithm to optimize sequence length, minimize redundancy, and enhance compression efficiency. Works independently of external grammatical or world knowledge.

Result: Significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. The approach effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, preserving token-based structure and semantic integrity.

Conclusion: The RL-based T5 compression method provides an efficient, adaptive system that leverages language model latent information, paving the way for robust and practical compression solutions across various applications while maintaining data format alignment.

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

TL;DR: LLMs show social task proficiency but lack a coherent, domain-general Theory of Mind when tested with cognitively-grounded evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs possess a genuine Theory of Mind (ToM) rather than just superficial social task performance, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that don't test for actual mental state representations.

Method: Developed a cognitively-grounded evaluation framework that probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior, testing them on logically equivalent tasks and measuring consistency between action predictions and mental state inferences.

Result: LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in simple ToM paradigms but fail at logically equivalent tasks and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

Conclusion: The social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent Theory of Mind, suggesting they lack the causal mental state representations posited by genuine ToM.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Motivation: LLMs show exceptional reasoning capabilities but remain fragile in scientific reasoning tasks due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. Current co-evolving paradigms work well in code and math domains but need improvement for scientific reasoning.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Use small annotated dataset to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier; 2) Introduce geometric reward mechanism considering consensus, reliability, and diversity to drive large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

Result: Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Sci-CoE enables LLMs to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning, improving scientific reasoning robustness and diversity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

### [105] [Statistical Parsing for Logical Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12170)
*Greg Coppola*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Quantified Boolean Bayesian Networks (QBBN) with negation/backward reasoning and adds a natural language parser, creating a complete system that combines LLMs for preprocessing/disambiguation with formal grammars for parsing and QBBNs for logical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two gaps from previous QBBN work: lack of negation/backward reasoning capabilities and absence of natural language parsing. Aims to reconcile formal semantics with modern LLM capabilities by using LLMs to eliminate annotation bottlenecks while maintaining formal verification through QBBNs.

Method: Extends QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning via backward lambda messages. Introduces typed logical language with role-labeled predicates and modal quantifiers. Develops typed slot grammar for deterministic sentence compilation to logical form. Uses LLMs for preprocessing/disambiguation, grammar for parsing, LLMs for reranking, and QBBN for inference.

Result: QBBN engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. Grammar achieves 33/33 correct logical form compilations with zero ambiguity. LLMs achieve 95% PP attachment accuracy for disambiguation but only 12.4% UAS for direct structured parsing, confirming grammar necessity. Complete architecture successfully integrates components.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges formal semantics with LLM capabilities, demonstrating that LLMs can eliminate annotation bottlenecks while QBBNs provide formal verification. The hybrid architecture reconciles formal NLP with Sutton's "bitter lesson" by using LLMs as annotators and QBBNs as verifiers.

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

*Bowei He,Yankai Chen,Xiaokun Zhang,Linghe Kong,Philip S. Yu,Xue Liu,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation using a three-stage IOA pipeline that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies, organizes progressive curricula, and adapts representations based on educational principles like Bloom's Mastery Learning and Vygotsky's ZPD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM distillation methods lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis task rather than a systematic learning process. There's a need for more educationally-informed approaches to improve knowledge transfer efficiency.

Method: Three-stage IOA pipeline: 1) Knowledge Identifier - identifies deficiencies in student models, 2) Organizer - organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, 3) Adapter - adapts representations to match student cognitive capacity. Integrates Bloom's Mastery Learning (students master prerequisites before advancing) and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (controlled difficulty increments).

Result: IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods: student models retain 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using <1/10th parameters. Particularly excels in complex reasoning: 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared to SOTA baselines. Tested with LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models.

Conclusion: The pedagogically-inspired IOA framework provides a systematic, educationally-grounded approach to LLM knowledge distillation that significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in complex reasoning tasks, while maintaining high parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Ge Gao,Shuai Wang,Duolikun Danier,Bin Zhu,Stevan Rudinac,David Bull,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder size by 88% while maintaining segmentation performance by replacing SAM3's large text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student optimized via knowledge distillation, based on analysis showing severe redundancy in segmentation prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language segmentation models like SAM3 use large, general-purpose text encoders designed for open-ended language understanding, but segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead from over-provisioned text encoder capacity.

Method: Conducted large-scale anatomical analysis of 404,796 real segmentation prompts across multiple benchmarks, revealing severe redundancy in context window utilization, vocabulary usage, and text embedding dimensionality. Proposed SAM3-LiteText framework that replaces original SAM3 text encoder with compact MobileCLIP student optimized through knowledge distillation.

Result: SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to original SAM3 model across image and video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates severe redundancy in text prompting for vision-language segmentation, enabling development of lightweight text encoding frameworks that maintain performance while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead through knowledge distillation and compact architecture design.

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

### [108] ["Sorry, I Didn't Catch That": How Speech Models Miss What Matters Most](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12249)
*Kaitlyn Zhou,Martijn Bartelds,Federico Bianchi,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes utterances like U.S. street names, with 44% error rate, disproportionately affecting non-English speakers. Synthetic data generation using TTS models improves accuracy by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite low word error rates on standard benchmarks, speech recognition systems fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments, particularly for linguistically diverse speakers. This study investigates transcription failures for U.S. street names, which have significant downstream consequences for navigation and location-based services.

Method: Evaluated 15 commercial speech recognition models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers. Introduced a synthetic data generation approach using open-source text-to-speech models to produce diverse pronunciations of named entities. Fine-tuned models with less than 1,000 synthetic samples.

Result: Average transcription error rate of 44% for street names. Mis-transcriptions cause systematic errors for all speakers, but routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. Fine-tuning with synthetic data improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Conclusion: There is a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems. Synthetic data generation provides a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors, particularly for linguistically diverse populations who are disproportionately affected by current system failures.

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

*Jianke Yang,Ohm Venkatachalam,Mohammad Kianezhad,Sharvaree Vadgama,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KeplerAgent is an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics scientific reasoning by first extracting physical properties, then using them as priors to guide symbolic regression for equation discovery, outperforming direct LLM and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based equation discovery systems directly guess equations from data without modeling the multi-step scientific reasoning process where scientists first infer physical properties (like symmetries) and use them as priors to constrain candidate equations.

Method: KeplerAgent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structural properties, then uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines (PySINDy, PySR) by setting their function libraries and structural constraints based on the inferred physical priors.

Result: Across physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data compared to both LLM baselines and traditional symbolic regression methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the scientific reasoning process through an agentic framework that extracts physical properties as priors significantly improves symbolic equation discovery performance over direct equation guessing approaches.

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

*Zhen Zhang,Kaiqiang Song,Xun Wang,Yebowen Hu,Weixiang Yan,Chenyang Zhao,Henry Peng Zou,Haoyun Deng,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Shujian Liu,Simin Ma,Xiaoyang Wang,Xin Eric Wang,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CM2 is an RL framework for multi-turn tool-using agents that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards, using fine-grained binary criteria with evidence grounding and structured metadata, trained in LLM-simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying RL to real-world AI agents is difficult because: 1) realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and emphasize open-ended behaviors, 2) RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is underexplored, and 3) building/maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage.

Method: CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into classification-style decisions. It uses sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment to avoid heavy engineering for large tool sets.

Result: Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, 10 points on BFCL-V4, and 12 points on ToolSandbox. Results match or outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model.

Conclusion: CM2 provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards, demonstrating consistent improvements over supervised fine-tuning across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

*Nicholas Lee,Lutfi Eren Erdogan,Chris Joseph John,Surya Krishnapillai,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATTS is a confidence-aware test-time scaling method that dynamically allocates compute for multi-step agents based on vote-derived uncertainty, improving performance while reducing token usage compared to uniform scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling improves neural network performance, but its behavior on multi-step agentic tasks is poorly understood. Uniform per-step compute allocation shows diminishing returns in long-horizon environments, and small errors compound over time. The authors aim to develop more efficient compute allocation strategies for multi-step agents.

Method: The authors first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents, finding uniform compute allocation saturates quickly. They investigate aggregation strategies including an LLM-based Arbiter and discover that uncertainty statistics (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) from the agent's vote distribution correlate with downstream success. Based on this, they develop CATTS (Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to dynamically allocate compute only when decisions are contentious.

Result: CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling. The method provides both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule based on uncertainty metrics.

Conclusion: Dynamic compute allocation based on vote-derived uncertainty is an effective strategy for multi-step agents. CATTS demonstrates that selectively allocating compute to contentious decisions improves performance while reducing computational costs, offering a practical solution for efficient test-time scaling in long-horizon agentic tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
