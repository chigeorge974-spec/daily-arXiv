<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable human operators to control multi-drone systems using natural language while maintaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer for evolving, high-level missions.

Method: Three-layer architecture: (1) human operator issues natural-language instructions, (2) LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects tasks based on latest state and target estimates, (3) distributed inner-loop controller tracks references using only local relative information.

Result: Derived theoretical guarantee characterizing tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates.

Conclusion: Centralized language-based task reasoning can be effectively combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability in multi-drone systems.

Abstract: We study language-in-the-loop control for multi-drone systems that execute evolving, high-level missions while retaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer. We propose a three-layer architecture in which (i) a human operator issues natural-language instructions, (ii) an LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects the commanded task in the context of the latest state and target estimates, and (iii) a distributed inner-loop controller tracks the resulting reference using only local relative information. We derive a theoretical guarantee that characterizes tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates. Overall, our results illustrate how centralized language-based task reasoning can be combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability.

*Xiaodong Zhang,Baorui Lv,Xavier Tao,Xiong Wang,Jie Bao,Yong He,Yue Chen,Zijiang Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DORA is a dataflow-oriented robotic middleware that reduces latency and CPU overhead through explicit data dependency specification and zero-copy data transmission, addressing inefficiencies in existing middleware for data-intensive robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic middleware have significant limitations for data-intensive applications: heavy reliance on (de)serialization causing overhead for large data, and inefficient support for heterogeneous data sizes in intra-robot communication and Python environments.

Method: Proposed Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture (DORA) with explicit data dependency specification and efficient zero-copy data transmission, implemented as an open-source system.

Result: Experimental evaluation in simulation and real-world robotic environments demonstrates substantial reductions in latency and CPU overhead compared to state-of-the-art middleware.

Conclusion: DORA effectively addresses communication efficiency challenges in data-intensive robotic applications through its dataflow-oriented approach with zero-copy transmission, improving system responsiveness and productivity.

Abstract: Robotic middleware serves as the foundational infrastructure, enabling complex robotic systems to operate in a coordinated and modular manner. In data-intensive robotic applications, especially in industrial scenarios, communication efficiency directly impact system responsiveness, stability, and overall productivity. However, existing robotic middleware exhibit several limitations: (1) they rely heavily on (de)serialization mechanisms, introducing significant overhead for large-sized data; (2) they lack efficient and flexible support for heterogeneous data sizes, particularly in intra-robot communication and Python-based execution environments. To address these challenges, we propose Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture (DORA) that enables explicit data dependency specification and efficient zero-copy data transmission. We implement the proposed framework as an open-source system and evaluate it through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and CPU overhead compared to state-of-the-art middleware.

*Noah Rubin,Ava Schraeder,Hrishikesh Sahu,Thomas C. Bulea,Lillian Chin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fluidic innervation uses 3D-printed silicone pads with embedded air channels to measure human-machine interface forces via pressure changes, demonstrating high linearity and correlation with limb torque/angle in various applications including exoskeletons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanical characterization of the human-machine interface is crucial for understanding user behavior and optimizing wearable robot performance, but has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses.

Method: Developed fluidic innervation using 3D-printed silicone pads with embedded air channels that compress under applied forces, creating measurable pressure changes detected by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. Tested in benchtop settings, clinical dynamometer correlations, cyclic curls, stepwise isometric holds, and integrated into a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton strap.

Result: Benchtop testing showed pad pressure was highly linearly related to applied force (R² = 0.998). Clinical dynamometer correlations showed above-knee pressure highly correlated with flexion torque (R² = 0.95) and below-knee pressure with extension torque (R² = 0.75). Pressure correlated with elbow angle during curls and isometric holds. Integrated sensor tracked squat phase and task dynamics consistently in exoskeleton testing.

Conclusion: Fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction, potentially providing an alternative real-time sensing input for controlling/optimizing wearable robotic systems and capturing user function during device use.

Abstract: Mechanically characterizing the human-machine interface is essential to understanding user behavior and optimizing wearable robot performance. This interface has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses. Here, we measure human limb-device interaction via fluidic innervation, creating a 3D-printed silicone pad with embedded air channels to measure forces. As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered. Pad pressure tracked squat phase and overall task dynamics consistently. Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction. In the long-term, this modality may provide an alternative real-time sensing input to control / optimize wearable robotic systems and to capture user function during device use.

### [4] [FlowHOI: Flow-based Semantics-Grounded Generation of Hand-Object Interactions for Dexterous Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13444)
*Huajian Zeng,Lingyun Chen,Jiaqi Yang,Yuantai Zhang,Fan Shi,Peidong Liu,Xingxing Zuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowHOI: A two-stage flow-matching framework for generating semantically grounded, temporally coherent hand-object interaction sequences from egocentric observations, language instructions, and 3D scene reconstructions, enabling robust manipulation planning and real-robot execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action models generate plausible motions but fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks due to lack of explicit hand-object interaction structure representation. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation would enable easier validation and transfer of manipulation behaviors across robots.

Method: Two-stage flow-matching framework: 1) decouples geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, 2) conditions on compact 3D scene tokens from Gaussian splatting reconstruction, 3) uses motion-text alignment loss for semantic grounding, 4) employs reconstruction pipeline to recover aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from egocentric videos for supervision.

Result: Achieves highest action recognition accuracy on GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, 1.7× higher physics simulation success rate than strongest diffusion-based baseline, with 40× inference speedup. Demonstrates real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: FlowHOI provides an effective embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures hand-object interaction structure, enabling robust generation of manipulation behaviors that can be retargeted to real-robot execution pipelines.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.

### [5] [Inferring Turn-Rate-Limited Engagement Zones with Sacrificial Agents for Safe Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13457)
*Grant Stagg,Cameron K. Peterson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learning-based framework estimates pursuer parameters in pursuit-evasion games using sacrificial agents with binary interception outcomes, enabling safe path planning for high-value agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe navigation of high-value agents in adversarial environments by accurately estimating pursuer capabilities (turn-rate limitations) through sacrificial agent observations.

Method: Uses sacrificial agents on straight-line trajectories with binary interception reports; relates outcomes to pursuer parameters via geometric reachable-region models (boundary and interior interception cases); employs gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions; proposes geometric heuristic and Bayesian experimental-design strategies for trajectory selection.

Result: Accurate parameter recovery achieved with 5-12 sacrificial agents in Monte Carlo experiments; learned engagement models successfully generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively estimates pursuer parameters through sacrificial agent observations, enabling safe path planning for high-value agents in adversarial pursuit-evasion scenarios with turn-rate-limited pursuers.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based framework for estimating pursuer parameters in turn-rate-limited pursuit-evasion scenarios using sacrificial agents. Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case.
  Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions.

*Noriaki Hirose,Catherine Glossop,Dhruv Shah,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AsyncVLA is an asynchronous control framework that decouples semantic reasoning from reactive execution to enable real-time deployment of large robotic foundation models by running them remotely while using a lightweight onboard adapter for high-frequency action refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic foundation models achieve strong generalization through internet-scale vision-language representations, but their massive computational cost creates high inference latency that breaks the control loop in dynamic environments, making them unsafe for real-time deployment.

Method: AsyncVLA decouples semantic reasoning from reactive execution using a hierarchical control approach: a large foundation model runs on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. The framework includes an end-to-end finetuning protocol and trajectory re-weighting strategy to bridge the domain gap between asynchronous streams.

Result: AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds, effectively bridging the gap between semantic intelligence of large models and reactivity required for edge robotics.

Conclusion: The AsyncVLA framework successfully addresses the latency bottleneck of large robotic foundation models by decoupling semantic reasoning from reactive execution, enabling safe real-time deployment in dynamic environments through asynchronous hierarchical control.

Abstract: Robotic foundation models achieve strong generalization by leveraging internet-scale vision-language representations, but their massive computational cost creates a fundamental bottleneck: high inference latency. In dynamic environments, this latency breaks the control loop, rendering powerful models unsafe for real-time deployment. We propose AsyncVLA, an asynchronous control framework that decouples semantic reasoning from reactive execution. Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics.

### [7] [ONRAP: Occupancy-driven Noise-Resilient Autonomous Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13577)
*Faizan M. Tariq,Avinash Singh,Vipul Ramtekkar,Jovin D'sa,David Isele,Yosuke Sakamoto,Sangjae Bae*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time occupancy-grid planner using nonlinear programming with bicycle model for robust navigation through static/dynamic obstacles, handling sensing noise and incomplete perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable dynamic path planning despite sensing noise, uncertain localization, and incomplete semantic perception; eliminate handcrafted heuristics while maintaining real-time performance.

Method: Nonlinear program in spatial domain using modified bicycle model with feasibility/collision-avoidance penalties; operates on occupancy grids optionally with occupancy-flow predictions; handles unknown obstacles via occupancy space.

Result: Real-time performance (>10 Hz), minimal tuning, clean control stack interface; validated in simulation with severe noise and on F1TENTH platform showing smooth safe maneuvering through narrow/rough routes.

Conclusion: Provides robust foundation for noise-resilient, prediction-aware planning without handcrafted heuristics; practical implementation-friendly approach for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Dynamic path planning must remain reliable in the presence of sensing noise, uncertain localization, and incomplete semantic perception. We propose a practical, implementation-friendly planner that operates on occupancy grids and optionally incorporates occupancy-flow predictions to generate ego-centric, kinematically feasible paths that safely navigate through static and dynamic obstacles. The core is a nonlinear program in the spatial domain built on a modified bicycle model with explicit feasibility and collision-avoidance penalties. The formulation naturally handles unknown obstacle classes and heterogeneous agent motion by operating purely in occupancy space. The pipeline runs in real-time (faster than 10 Hz on average), requires minimal tuning, and interfaces cleanly with standard control stacks. We validate our approach in simulation with severe localization and perception noises, and on an F1TENTH platform, demonstrating smooth and safe maneuvering through narrow passages and rough routes. The approach provides a robust foundation for noise-resilient, prediction-aware planning, eliminating the need for handcrafted heuristics.

### [8] [TactAlign: Human-to-Robot Policy Transfer via Tactile Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13579)
*Youngsun Wi,Jessica Yin,Elvis Xiang,Akash Sharma,Jitendra Malik,Mustafa Mukadam,Nima Fazeli,Tess Hellebrekers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TactAlign enables cross-embodiment tactile alignment for human-to-robot policy transfer without paired data or identical sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human demonstrations with tactile feedback provide rich supervision for robot learning, but existing H2R approaches require identical tactile sensors, paired data, and minimal embodiment gaps, limiting scalability and generality.

Method: TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using rectified flow, enabling low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs without requiring paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information.

Result: TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with minimal human data (<5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).

Conclusion: TactAlign provides a scalable, generalizable approach for cross-embodiment tactile alignment that overcomes limitations of existing H2R methods by eliminating requirements for identical sensors, paired data, and minimal embodiment gaps.

Abstract: Human demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgentRob is a framework that connects LLM-powered agents to physical robots through online forums using Model Context Protocol, enabling autonomous agents to participate in communities, extract commands from posts, execute physical actions, and report back results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM-powered autonomous agents have shown strong capabilities in virtual environments, their integration with the physical world remains limited to direct control interfaces. There's a need to bridge the gap between online communities, AI agents, and physical robotics.

Method: AgentRob uses a three-layer architecture: 1) Forum Layer for asynchronous, persistent multi-agent interaction; 2) Agent Layer with forum agents that poll for @mention-targeted commands; 3) Robot Layer with VLM-driven controllers and Unitree Go2/G1 hardware that translate commands into robot primitives via iterative tool calling. The system employs Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect these components.

Result: The framework successfully enables multiple concurrent agents with distinct identities and physical embodiments to coexist in the same forum, demonstrating the feasibility of forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration. Agents can read forum posts, extract natural language commands, dispatch physical robot actions, and report results back to the community.

Conclusion: AgentRob establishes a novel paradigm where autonomous agents participate in online forums to interact with physical robots, bridging the gap between virtual communities and physical robotics through the Model Context Protocol. This enables forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration with distinct agent identities and physical embodiments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents have demonstrated significant capabilities in virtual environments, yet their integration with the physical world remains narrowly confined to direct control interfaces. We present AgentRob, a framework that bridges online community forums, LLM-powered agents, and physical robots through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentRob enables a novel paradigm where autonomous agents participate in online forums--reading posts, extracting natural language commands, dispatching physical robot actions, and reporting results back to the community. The system comprises three layers: a Forum Layer providing asynchronous, persistent, multi-agent interaction; an Agent Layer with forum agents that poll for @mention-targeted commands; and a Robot Layer with VLM-driven controllers and Unitree Go2/G1 hardware that translate commands into robot primitives via iterative tool calling. The framework supports multiple concurrent agents with distinct identities and physical embodiments coexisting in the same forum, establishing the feasibility of forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration.

### [10] [Hierarchical Audio-Visual-Proprioceptive Fusion for Precise Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13640)
*Siyuan Li,Jiani Lu,Yu Song,Xianren Li,Bo An,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical multimodal fusion framework that integrates audio, vision, and proprioception for robotic manipulation, using acoustic cues to condition other modalities and diffusion-based policy for action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic manipulation methods rely on visual and proprioceptive observations but struggle with contact-related interaction states in partially observable environments. Acoustic cues naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact but remain underexploited. Current multimodal fusion approaches assume homogeneous roles across modalities with flat symmetric structures, which is ill-suited for sparse, contact-driven acoustic signals.

Method: Proposes hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. First conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies. Uses diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. End-to-end learning with hierarchical fusion enables exploitation of task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities.

Result: Evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks (liquid pouring and cabinet opening). Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Mutual information analysis conducted to interpret effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: Hierarchical multimodal fusion with acoustic conditioning enables precise robotic manipulation by effectively leveraging contact-driven acoustic cues that encode rich interaction dynamics, overcoming limitations of flat symmetric fusion approaches that assume homogeneous modality roles.

Abstract: Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.

*Yaoyu Li,Chaosheng Huang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPLIT is a sparse incremental learning framework for vehicle dynamics modeling that addresses computational limitations of GP-based residual models through model decomposition, local incremental learning, and GP sparsification for real-time control applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid vehicle models combining nominal models with GP-based residuals face deployment challenges due to curse of dimensionality, high evaluation complexity, and inefficient online learning, preventing real-time controller implementation.

Method: SPLIT integrates three innovations: 1) Model decomposition into invariant (experiment-calibrated) and variant (residual-compensated) elements to reduce feature dimensionality; 2) Local incremental learning with valid region partitioning for efficient online learning from streaming data; 3) GP sparsification using Bayesian committee machine for scalable online evaluation.

Result: SPLIT improves model accuracy and control performance online, enables rapid adaptation to vehicle dynamics deviations, and exhibits robust generalization to previously unseen scenarios in both aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments.

Conclusion: SPLIT successfully addresses computational limitations of GP-based residual models for vehicle dynamics modeling, providing accurate, computationally efficient, and adaptive models suitable for real-time autonomous vehicle control applications.

Abstract: Accurate, computationally efficient, and adaptive vehicle models are essential for autonomous vehicle control. Hybrid models that combine a nominal model with a Gaussian Process (GP)-based residual model have emerged as a promising approach. However, the GP-based residual model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, high evaluation complexity, and the inefficiency of online learning, which impede the deployment in real-time vehicle controllers. To address these challenges, we propose SPLIT, a sparse incremental learning framework for control-oriented vehicle dynamics modeling. SPLIT integrates three key innovations: (i) Model Decomposition. We decompose the vehicle model into invariant elements calibrated by experiments, and variant elements compensated by the residual model to reduce feature dimensionality. (ii) Local Incremental Learning. We define the valid region in the feature space and partition it into subregions, enabling efficient online learning from streaming data. (iii) GP Sparsification. We use bayesian committee machine to ensure scalable online evaluation. Integrated into model-based controllers, SPLIT is evaluated in aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments. Results demonstrate that SPLIT improves model accuracy and control performance online. Moreover, it enables rapid adaptation to vehicle dynamics deviations and exhibits robust generalization to previously unseen scenarios.

*Zhongxiang Lei,Lulu Cao,Xuyang Wang,Tianyi Qian,Jinyan Liu,Xuesong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KungFuAthlete dataset captures high-dynamic martial arts motions with extreme velocities, enabling unified policy training for both motion tracking and fall recovery in humanoid robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid motion tracking systems lack robustness at performance limits, especially for highly dynamic motions like martial arts. Existing datasets don't capture extreme motion intensity, and prior work lacks unified strategies for handling unsafe states and enabling autonomous recovery from failures.

Method: Constructed KungFuAthlete dataset from professional athletes' training videos, including ground and jump subsets. Proposed novel training paradigm enabling a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery within one unified framework.

Result: KungFuAthlete dataset shows substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS datasets. The unified framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution for more robust performance.

Conclusion: The approach addresses gaps in high-dynamic motion representation and recovery strategies, enabling humanoid robots to handle extreme scenarios with both agile execution and autonomous stabilization capabilities.

Abstract: Current humanoid motion tracking systems can execute routine and moderately dynamic behaviors, yet significant gaps remain near hardware performance limits and algorithmic robustness boundaries. Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios.

TL;DR: Cross-Modal Transformer with physics-informed regularization achieves 96.59% insertion success by effectively fusing vision and tactile signals, approaching privileged sensing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insertion tasks require precise contact-rich interactions that vision alone cannot resolve, and existing naïve visuo-tactile fusion methods fail to deliver consistent improvements despite the intuitive value of tactile feedback.

Method: Proposes a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. Introduces physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance to stabilize tactile embeddings, reflecting principles of human motor control.

Result: CMT with symmetry regularization achieves 96.59% insertion success rate on TacSL benchmark, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%).

Conclusion: Tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and principled multimodal fusion strengthened by physics-informed regularization unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.

Abstract: Insertion tasks in robotic manipulation demand precise, contact-rich interactions that vision alone cannot resolve. While tactile feedback is intuitively valuable, existing studies have shown that naïve visuo-tactile fusion often fails to deliver consistent improvements. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for visuo-tactile fusion that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.

Method: HybridFlow is a 3-stage method with 2 neural function evaluations (NFE): 1) Global Jump in MeanFlow mode for rapid initial generation, 2) ReNoise for distribution alignment, and 3) Local Refine in ReFlow mode for precision improvement. This hybrid approach leverages MeanFlow's speed advantage while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps.

Result: HybridFlow outperforms 16-step Diffusion Policy by 15-25% in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (8× speedup, ~52Hz). It achieves 70.0% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3% on deformable object folding tasks.

Conclusion: HybridFlow provides a practical low-latency method that balances inference speed and generation quality, enhancing real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies by achieving both high speed and precision.

Abstract: Limited by inference latency, existing robot manipulation policies lack sufficient real-time interaction capability with the environment. Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.

*Chen Feng,Yang Xu,Shaojie Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FC-Vision is a real-time visibility-aware replanning framework for UAV scanning that proactively prevents target occlusions while maintaining coverage and efficiency, achieving significant improvements in scanning quality under unexpected obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous aerial scanning methods focus on collision avoidance and efficiency but neglect occlusion-induced visibility degradation, which severely compromises scanning quality when encountering unknown obstacles during flight.

Method: FC-Vision uses a two-level decomposition approach: 1) occlusion-free viewpoint repair that maintains coverage with minimal deviation from nominal scan intent, and 2) segment-wise clean-sensing connection in 5-DoF space. It enforces dense surface-visibility constraints for real-time replanning and offers plug-in integration with existing UAV systems.

Result: The framework achieves maximum coverage gain of 55.32% and 73.17% reduction in occlusion ratio while maintaining real-time performance with moderate flight time increase. It consistently improves scanning quality under unexpected occluders in both simulation and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: FC-Vision effectively addresses the critical gap in visibility-aware replanning for aerial scanning, providing a practical solution that can be integrated into existing UAV systems without architectural changes to significantly enhance scanning quality in occluded environments.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial scanning of target structures is crucial for practical applications, requiring online adaptation to unknown obstacles during flight. Existing methods largely emphasize collision avoidance and efficiency, but overlook occlusion-induced visibility degradation, severely compromising scanning quality. In this study, we propose FC-Vision, an on-the-fly visibility-aware replanning framework that proactively and safely prevents target occlusions while preserving the intended coverage and efficiency of the original plan. Our approach explicitly enforces dense surface-visibility constraints to regularize replanning behavior in real-time via an efficient two-level decomposition: occlusion-free viewpoint repair that maintains coverage with minimal deviation from the nominal scan intent, followed by segment-wise clean-sensing connection in 5-DoF space. A plug-in integration strategy is also presented to seamlessly interface FC-Vision with existing UAV scanning systems without architectural changes. Comprehensive simulation and real-world evaluations show that FC-Vision consistently improves scanning quality under unexpected occluders, delivering a maximum coverage gain of 55.32% and a 73.17% reduction in the occlusion ratio, while achieving real-time performance with a moderate increase in flight time. The source code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Personalized speed profile adjustment for Predictive Longitudinal Driving Function using driver intervention feedback to improve satisfaction and reduce interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver interventions during ADAS use contain valuable feedback about deviations from personal preferences, which should be utilized to optimize and personalize driving function behavior.

Method: Algorithm that iteratively adjusts PLDF's speed profile by combining original PLDF profile with driver demonstrations, enabling personalization during traded control scenarios.

Result: Driving simulator study with 43 participants showed significant increase in driver satisfaction and significant reduction in intervention frequency with adaptive PLDF.

Conclusion: Personalization through driver intervention feedback effectively improves ADAS acceptance and performance, with identified optimization potentials for further system enhancement.

Abstract: During the use of advanced driver assistance systems, drivers frequently intervene into the active driving function and adjust the system's behavior to their personal wishes. These active driver-initiated takeovers contain feedback about deviations in the driving function's behavior from the drivers' personal preferences. This feedback should be utilized to optimize and personalize the driving function's behavior. In this work, the adjustment of the speed profile of a Predictive Longitudinal Driving Function (PLDF) on a pre-defined route is highlighted. An algorithm is introduced which iteratively adjusts the PLDF's speed profile by taking into account both the original speed profile of the PLDF and the driver demonstration. This approach allows for personalization in a traded control scenario during active use of the PLDF. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is tested in a driving simulator-based test group study with 43 participants. The study finds a significant increase in driver satisfaction and a significant reduction in the intervention frequency when using the proposed adaptive PLDF. Additionally, feedback by the participants was gathered to identify further optimization potentials of the proposed system.

*Mal Fazliu,Matthew Coombes,Sen Wang,Cunjia Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: XIT is a sampling-based informative path planner for autonomous mobile robotic gas distribution mapping that balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs using UCB information fields and gas frontiers for efficient plume-aware navigation in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gas distribution mapping systems rely heavily on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed during hazardous gas emergencies. Autonomous active GDM is challenging because robots must simultaneously explore unknown environments, map traversable space, and infer gas distributions from sparse chemical measurements while navigating cluttered areas.

Method: Formulates active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning problem. Proposes XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that: 1) draws batches of samples from a UCB information field derived from the gas posterior, 2) expands trees using a cost function trading off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty, 3) introduces gas frontiers (unobserved regions adjacent to high concentrations) for plume-aware exploration, and 4) implements Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for frontier identification.

Result: High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved GDM quality and efficiency compared to existing methods. The approach effectively balances exploration of unknown areas with exploitation of known gas concentration regions for optimal information gathering.

Conclusion: XIT successfully addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off in autonomous active gas distribution mapping, enabling efficient plume-aware navigation in unknown environments. Although developed for GDM, the framework is generalizable to other robotic information-gathering tasks facing similar trade-offs in unknown environments.

Abstract: Mobile robotic gas distribution mapping (GDM) provides critical situational awareness during emergency responses to hazardous gas releases. However, most systems still rely on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed. Autonomous active GDM is challenging in unknown and cluttered environments, because the robot must simultaneously explore traversable space, map the environment, and infer the gas distribution belief from sparse chemical measurements. We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty. To enable plume-aware exploration, we introduce the gas frontier concept, defined as unobserved regions adjacent to high gas concentrations, and propose the Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for their identification. High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the benefits of XIT in terms of GDM quality and efficiency. Although developed for active GDM, XIT is readily applicable to other robotic information-gathering tasks in unknown environments that face the exploration and exploitation trade-off.

Motivation: Neuromorphic hardware offers benefits for robotics (low energy, low latency, unique learning methods), but complex multimodal tasks require orchestrating multiple networks without resorting to off-chip process management logic, which has been a persistent hurdle.

Method: Developed a pipeline for vision-based robot control using a spiking neural state machine for process orchestration, enabling numerous complex networks to run entirely on neuromorphic hardware. Validated on Intel Loihi 2 research chip with all components running concurrently on-chip.

Conclusion: The spiking neural state machine approach successfully addresses the orchestration challenge for multiple neuromorphic networks, enabling complex vision-based robot control pipelines to run entirely on-chip with low power consumption and competitive performance.

Abstract: It has long been realized that neuromorphic hardware offers benefits for the domain of robotics such as low energy, low latency, as well as unique methods of learning. In aiming for more complex tasks, especially those incorporating multimodal data, one hurdle continuing to prevent their realization is an inability to orchestrate multiple networks on neuromorphic hardware without resorting to off-chip process management logic. To address this, we show a first example of a pipeline for vision-based robot control in which numerous complex networks can be run entirely on hardware via the use of a spiking neural state machine for process orchestration. The pipeline is validated on the Intel Loihi 2 research chip. We show that all components can run concurrently on-chip in the milli Watt regime at latencies competitive with the state-of-the-art. An equivalent network on simulated hardware is shown to accomplish robotic arm plug insertion in simulation, and the core elements of the pipeline are additionally tested on a real robotic arm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel method for optimizing robot postures to reduce impact-induced state spikes by minimizing velocity variation between pre- and post-impact states using gradient-based motion tasks integrated with whole-body control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety and robustness of torque-controlled robots during impacts by reducing spikes in robot state and input commands that can lead to instability or actuator saturation.

Method: Uses rigid impact model to create configuration-dependent metric quantifying pre- to post-impact velocity variation. Formulates min-max optimization problem, then reformulates as real-time gradient-based motion task embedded within task-space inverse dynamics whole-body controller.

Result: Achieved up to 51% reduction in post-impact spikes in robot configuration compared to standard TSID, successfully avoided actuator saturation. Additional simulations on quadruped and humanoid showed up to 45% reduction in post-impact state spikes.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves impact robustness for kinematically redundant robots, demonstrating significant reductions in post-impact state spikes and prevention of actuator saturation through posture optimization integrated with whole-body control.

Abstract: We present a novel method for optimizing the posture of kinematically redundant torque-controlled robots to improve robustness during impacts. A rigid impact model is used as the basis for a configuration-dependent metric that quantifies the variation between pre- and post-impact velocities. By finding configurations (postures) that minimize the aforementioned metric, spikes in the robot's state and input commands can be significantly reduced during impacts, improving safety and robustness. The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID.

TL;DR: MOTIF enables efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer for robotic learning by decoupling embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns (action motifs) from heterogeneous action data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-embodiment transfer in vision-language-action models is challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations for fine-tuning. Existing shared-private architectures have limited capacity and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms.

Method: MOTIF learns unified action motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints for temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. A lightweight predictor then predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states for action generation on new embodiments.

Result: MOTIF significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings across both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: MOTIF provides an effective approach for cross-embodiment transfer by decoupling embodiment-agnostic patterns from heterogeneous action data, enabling efficient few-shot adaptation to new robotic embodiments.

Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to derive conclusions from experiences that are both logically sound and communicated in ways aligned with human expectations, requiring explanations that are semantically grounded and natural.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Building effective human-robot interaction requires robots to derive conclusions from their experiences that are both logically sound and communicated in ways aligned with human expectations. This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration.

### [22] [Semantic-Contact Fields for Category-Level Generalizable Tactile Tool Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13833)
*Kevin Yuchen Ma,Heng Zhang,Weisi Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Yan Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCFields is a unified 3D representation combining visual semantics with dense contact estimates, trained via a two-stage sim-to-real pipeline, enabling robust category-level generalization for contact-rich tool manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot policies face a gap: VLA models lack physical grounding for contact-rich manipulation, while contact-aware policies using tactile sensing are instance-specific and don't generalize across diverse tool geometries. Real-world tactile data collection is prohibitive at scale, and sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to complex soft sensor dynamics.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields) - a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. Uses a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: 1) pre-train on large simulation dataset to learn general contact physics, 2) fine-tune on small real dataset pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization to align sensor characteristics. SCFields serve as dense observation input for a diffusion policy.

Result: Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling tasks demonstrate robust category-level generalization to unseen tools, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.

Conclusion: SCFields bridge the gap between semantic planning and precise physical control by learning unified contact representations from diverse data through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling physical generalization to unseen tools for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.
  To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.

Conclusion: Hybrid prehensile/non-prehensile action primitives like push-placement can significantly improve efficiency in long-horizon rearrangement tasks by reducing explicit buffering requirements.

Abstract: Efficient tabletop rearrangement remains challenging due to collisions and the need for temporary buffering when target poses are obstructed. Prehensile pick-and-place provides precise control but often requires extra moves, whereas non-prehensile pushing can be more efficient but suffers from complex, imprecise dynamics.

Motivation: Enable long-horizon humanoid box rearrangement by developing a skill-based framework that sequences reusable skills, addressing challenges of robustness and distribution shifts when reusing pretrained controllers across skill compositions.

Method: Propose a skill-based architecture where all skills execute through a shared, task-agnostic whole-body controller (WBC). Address robustness issues with data aggregation that augments shared-WBC training using rollouts from closed-loop skill execution under domain randomization.

Result: Introduce Humanoid Hanoi benchmark for long-horizon Tower-of-Hanoi box rearrangement. Demonstrate fully autonomous rearrangement over extended horizons in simulation and on Digit V3 humanoid robot, showing benefits of shared-WBC approach over non-shared baselines.

Conclusion: Shared whole-body controller framework enables robust long-horizon humanoid box rearrangement through skill composition, with data aggregation addressing distribution shifts from new skills and their compositions.

Abstract: We investigate a skill-based framework for humanoid box rearrangement that enables long-horizon execution by sequencing reusable skills at the task level. In our architecture, all skills execute through a shared, task-agnostic whole-body controller (WBC), providing a consistent closed-loop interface for skill composition, in contrast to non-shared designs that use separate low-level controllers per skill. We find that naively reusing the same pretrained WBC can reduce robustness over long horizons, as new skills and their compositions induce shifted state and command distributions. We address this with a simple data aggregation procedure that augments shared-WBC training with rollouts from closed-loop skill execution under domain randomization. To evaluate the approach, we introduce \emph{Humanoid Hanoi}, a long-horizon Tower-of-Hanoi box rearrangement benchmark, and report results in simulation and on the Digit V3 humanoid robot, demonstrating fully autonomous rearrangement over extended horizons and quantifying the benefits of the shared-WBC approach over non-shared baselines.

TL;DR: A large-scale real-world UAV dataset for anomaly detection in state estimation, comprising 1396 flight logs (52+ hours) from PX4-based UAVs with diverse sensor configurations, featuring naturally occurring anomalies categorized into four classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation is crucial for UAV reliability and safety, but existing datasets rely on simulated/injected faults rather than real-world anomalies, creating a gap for realistic anomaly detection research.

Method: Collection of 1396 real flight logs from PX4-based UAVs across diverse indoor/outdoor environments with various sensor configurations, followed by a structured classification system categorizing anomalies into four classes based on observed patterns in multivariate sensor data.

Result: A comprehensive dataset with both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, featuring four anomaly classes: mechanical/electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies, derived from real sensor data streams.

Conclusion: This real-world dataset addresses a critical gap in UAV reliability research by providing authentic anomaly data for developing, training, and evaluating anomaly detection systems, moving beyond synthetic fault injection approaches.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for ensuring reliable and safe operation, as anomalies occurring during mission execution may induce discrepancies between expected and observed system behaviors, thereby compromising mission success or posing potential safety hazards. It is essential to continuously monitor and detect such conditions in order to ensure a timely response and maintain system reliability. In this work, we focus on UAV state estimation anomalies and provide a large-scale real-world UAV dataset to facilitate research aimed at improving the development of anomaly detection. Unlike existing datasets that primarily rely on injected faults into simulated data, this dataset comprises 1396 real flight logs totaling over 52 hours of flight time, collected across diverse indoor and outdoor environments using a collection of PX4-based UAVs equipped with a variety of sensor configurations. The dataset comprises both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, making it uniquely suitable for realistic anomaly detection tasks. A structured classification is proposed that categorizes UAV state estimation anomalies into four classes: mechanical and electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies. These classifications reflect collective, contextual, and outlier anomalies observed in multivariate sensor data streams, including IMU, GPS, barometer, magnetometer, distance sensors, visual odometry, and optical flow, that can be found in the PX4 logging mechanism. It is anticipated that this dataset will play a key role in the development, training, and evaluation of anomaly detection and isolation systems to address the critical gap in UAV reliability research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified pipeline integrating radiance field methods (NeRF and Gaussian Splatting) for automated 3D environment reconstruction in planetary robotics, addressing limitations of traditional SfM/SLAM in low-texture extraterrestrial terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planetary rovers require autonomous spatial awareness and visual localization under severe constraints (no GPS, communication delays, low-texture environments). Traditional SfM/SLAM methods struggle with radiometric detail and scalability in unstructured extraterrestrial terrains.

Method: Integration of radiance field-based methods (NeRF and Gaussian Splatting) into a unified automated pipeline using Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with ROS2-compatible workflow that processes raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings.

Result: The system generates dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems in planetary-like conditions.

Conclusion: The pipeline establishes a foundation for radiance field-based mapping in planetary exploration, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations for future research in autonomous robotic systems.

Abstract: Planetary exploration increasingly relies on autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and reconstructing their surroundings in the absence of global positioning or real-time communication with Earth. Rovers operating on planetary surfaces must navigate under sever environmental constraints, limited visual redundancy, and communication delays, making onboard spatial awareness and visual localization key components for mission success. Traditional techniques based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) provide geometric consistency but struggle to capture radiometric detail or to scale efficiently in unstructured, low-texture terrains typical of extraterrestrial environments. This work explores the integration of radiance field-based methods - specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting - into a unified, automated environment reconstruction pipeline for planetary robotics. Our system combines the Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with a ROS2-compatible workflow capable of processing raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings. This approach enables the generation of dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems operating in planetary-like conditions. The resulting pipeline established a foundation for future research in radiance field-based mapping, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations in planetary exploration.

### [28] [Joint Task Assistance Planning via Nested Branch and Bound (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13932)
*Omer Daube,Oren Salzman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Joint Task Assistance Planning problem for two robots where one executes a timed mission and the other provides sensor-based support, with the goal of maximizing assistance duration using a nested branch-and-bound framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize prior work on optimizing assistance in robotic collaboration by addressing the combinatorial explosion of possible path combinations and temporal constraints in multi-robot assistance scenarios.

Method: Propose a nested branch-and-bound framework that efficiently explores the space of robot paths in a hierarchical manner to solve the Joint Task Assistance Planning problem.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to a baseline approach.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical branch-and-bound framework effectively addresses the computational challenges of Joint Task Assistance Planning, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: We introduce and study the Joint Task Assistance Planning problem which generalizes prior work on optimizing assistance in robotic collaboration. In this setting, two robots operate over predefined roadmaps, each represented as a graph corresponding to its configuration space. One robot, the task robot, must execute a timed mission, while the other, the assistance robot, provides sensor-based support that depends on their spatial relationship. The objective is to compute a path for both robots that maximizes the total duration of assistance given. Solving this problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible path combinations together with the temporal nature of the problem (time needs to be accounted for as well). To address this, we propose a nested branch-and-bound framework that efficiently explores the space of robot paths in a hierarchical manner. We empirically evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude when compared to a baseline approach.

*Zhennan Jiang,Shangqing Zhou,Yutong Jiang,Zefang Huang,Mingjie Wei,Yuhui Chen,Tianxing Zhou,Zhen Guo,Hao Lin,Quanlu Zhang,Yu Wang,Haoran Li,Chao Yu,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WoVR is a world-model-based RL framework that enables stable policy optimization for VLA models by explicitly controlling hallucination in imagined rollouts, achieving significant performance gains on both simulated and real-world robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL requires massive real-world interaction which is impractical for physical robots. While world models can serve as simulators, they suffer from hallucination and error accumulation that corrupt the optimization signal, causing policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than learn genuine task progress.

Method: WoVR regulates RL interaction with imperfect imagined dynamics through three key components: 1) A controllable action-conditioned video world model for improved rollout stability, 2) Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts that reshape imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth, and 3) World Model-Policy co-evolution to maintain alignment between policy and simulator.

Result: WoVR improves average LIBERO benchmark success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot manipulation success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points), demonstrating stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization.

Conclusion: Learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled, enabling effective post-training of VLA policies without requiring massive real-world interaction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.

*Haozheng Xu,Wenhao Li,Zifan Wei,Bo Jin,Hongxing Bai,Ben Yang,Xiangfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WareRover is a holistic simulation platform that tightly couples order scheduling and multi-agent pathfinding in robotic warehouse systems, addressing the limitations of existing decoupled approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RMFS approaches treat order scheduling and multi-agent pathfinding as isolated sub-problems, creating a fundamental bottleneck that masks critical dependencies between high-level dispatching and low-level congestion. Existing simulators fail to bridge this gap by abstracting away heterogeneous kinematics and stochastic execution failures.

Method: WareRover enforces tight coupling between order scheduling and MAPF through a unified, closed-loop optimization interface. It integrates dynamic order streams, physics-aware motion constraints, and non-nominal recovery mechanisms into a single evaluation loop, unlike standard benchmarks.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art algorithms often falter under realistic coupled constraints, demonstrating that WareRover provides a necessary and challenging testbed for robust, next-generation warehouse coordination.

Conclusion: WareRover addresses the critical gap in existing RMFS simulation by providing a holistic platform that captures the complex interdependencies between scheduling and pathfinding, offering a more realistic evaluation environment for warehouse coordination algorithms.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) typically treats order scheduling and multi-agent pathfinding as isolated sub-problems. We argue that this decoupling is a fundamental bottleneck, masking the critical dependencies between high-level dispatching and low-level congestion. Existing simulators fail to bridge this gap, often abstracting away heterogeneous kinematics and stochastic execution failures. We propose WareRover, a holistic simulation platform that enforces a tight coupling between OS and MAPF via a unified, closed-loop optimization interface. Unlike standard benchmarks, WareRover integrates dynamic order streams, physics-aware motion constraints, and non-nominal recovery mechanisms into a single evaluation loop. Experiments reveal that SOTA algorithms often falter under these realistic coupled constraints, demonstrating that WareRover provides a necessary and challenging testbed for robust, next-generation warehouse coordination.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboAug is a generative data augmentation framework that enhances robotic learning generalization using only single-image bounding box annotations, reducing reliance on large-scale pretraining and perfect visual recognition assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic learning approaches require labor-intensive large-scale pretraining or assume perfect upstream object detection, which is impractical for real-world deployment. There's a need for methods that minimize data requirements while improving generalization to unseen scenes.

Method: RoboAug uses pre-trained generative models for semantic data augmentation with only single-image bounding box annotations. It integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to focus models on task-relevant regions, enhancing generalization without extensive pretraining.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments across three robots (UR-5e, AgileX, Tien Kung 2.0) with over 35k rollouts show RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Success rates improved from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0 in unseen scenes.

Conclusion: RoboAug demonstrates superior generalization capability for robotic manipulation tasks by minimizing data requirements while substantially improving performance in diverse, unseen environments, offering a practical solution for real-world robotic deployment.

Abstract: Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks. Our project is available at https://x-roboaug.github.io/.

### [32] [ProAct: A Dual-System Framework for Proactive Embodied Social Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14048)
*Zeyi Zhang,Zixi Kang,Ruijie Zhao,Yusen Feng,Biao Jiang,Libin Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ProAct is a dual-system framework that enables proactive social behavior in embodied agents by separating low-latency reactive interaction from slower cognitive reasoning, using flow-matching for seamless intention injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied social agents are mostly reactive, responding only to immediate sensory inputs, which limits their ability to exhibit proactive social behavior requiring deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference within real-time interaction constraints.

Method: ProAct uses a dual-system framework: 1) a low-latency Behavioral System for streaming multimodal interaction, and 2) a slower Cognitive System for long-horizon social reasoning and proactive intention generation. A streaming flow-matching model with ControlNet conditioning enables asynchronous intention injection for seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures.

Result: The system was deployed on a physical humanoid robot and evaluated through real-world interaction studies. Participants and observers consistently preferred ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement.

Conclusion: The dual-system proactive control framework successfully reconciles the time-scale conflict between real-time interaction and social reasoning, demonstrating significant benefits for embodied social interaction through improved proactivity, social presence, and engagement.

Abstract: Embodied social agents have recently advanced in generating synchronized speech and gestures. However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.

Conclusion: SemanticFeels successfully integrates semantic labeling with neural implicit shape representation, enabling robots to perceive both geometry and material properties during in-hand manipulation.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, their ability to perceive both the shape and properties of objects during in-hand manipulation becomes critical for adaptive and intelligent behavior. We present SemanticFeels, an extension of the NeuralFeels framework that integrates semantic labeling with neural implicit shape representation, from vision and touch. To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.

*Xinan Rong,Changhuang Wan,Aochen He,Xiaolong Li,Gangshan Jing*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination enables high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects without tactile feedback by converting force planning to joint trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise in-hand manipulation of force-sensitive objects requires coordinated force planning and accurate contact force feedback, but multi-fingered hands face challenges: they rely solely on fingertip point contacts, cannot apply pull forces, and lack calibrated torque sensors in most commercial dexterous hands.

Method: A dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination that solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints, then employs a force-to-position mapping to convert planned force trajectories to joint trajectories for joint control without tactile feedback.

Result: The framework was validated on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating capability to manipulate fragile objects including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg with high precision and safety.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback, addressing key challenges in multi-fingered hand manipulation through coordinated force planning and force-to-position mapping.

Abstract: Precise in-hand manipulation of force-sensitive objects typically requires judicious coordinated force planning as well as accurate contact force feedback and control. Unlike multi-arm platforms with gripper end effectors, multi-fingered hands rely solely on fingertip point contacts and are not able to apply pull forces, therefore poses a more challenging problem. Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory. We validate the framework on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating the capability to manipulate fragile objects-including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg-with high precision and safety.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sim-to-real transfer framework for contact-rich manipulation that uses privileged supervision from expert-designed controllers to learn robust force direction predictions, combined with lightweight manual tuning of force magnitudes for adaptive compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation is challenging due to contact dynamics discrepancies. Existing methods either require costly real-world data or use blind compliance through fixed controllers, lacking adaptability to task geometry.

Method: Leverages expert-designed finite state machine based position/force controllers in simulation for privileged supervision. Trains policy to predict end-effector pose, contact state, and desired contact force direction (not magnitude). Combines policy's directional intent with manually tuned constant force magnitudes in a force-aware admittance controller at deployment.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on four real-world tasks: microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, achieving higher success rates and robustness. Lightweight tuning requires only a single scalar per contact state.

Conclusion: Force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across sim-to-real gap, while force magnitudes are sensitive to simulation inaccuracies. Combining learned directional intent with manually tuned magnitudes enables adaptive, task-aligned compliance with theoretical stability guarantees.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to the inherent discrepancy in contact dynamics. While existing methods often rely on costly real-world data or utilize blind compliance through fixed controllers, we propose a framework that leverages expert-designed controller logic for transfer. Inspired by the success of privileged supervision in kinematic tasks, we employ a human-designed finite state machine based position/force controller in simulation to provide privileged guidance. The resulting policy is trained to predict the end-effector pose, contact state, and crucially the desired contact force direction. Unlike force magnitudes, which are highly sensitive to simulation inaccuracies, force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across the sim-to-real gap. At deployment, these predictions configure a force-aware admittance controller. By combining the policy's directional intent with a constant, low-cost manually tuned force magnitude, the system generates adaptive, task-aligned compliance. This tuning is lightweight, typically requiring only a single scalar per contact state. We provide theoretical analysis for stability and robustness to disturbances. Experiments on four real-world tasks, i.e., microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines in both success rate and robustness.

*Yue Chen,Muqing Jiang,Kaifeng Zheng,Jiaqi Liang,Chenrui Tie,Haoran Lu,Ruihai Wu,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PA3FF is a part-aware 3D feature field for articulated object manipulation that addresses limitations of 2D foundation features in 3D space, enabling better generalization across diverse objects through functional part understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing articulated object manipulation across diverse objects is challenging. Existing 2D foundation features lack part awareness and face issues when lifted to 3D space, including runtime inefficiency, multi-view inconsistencies, and insufficient geometric information.

Method: PA3FF is trained using 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset via contrastive learning. It predicts a continuous 3D feature field from point clouds where feature distance reflects functional part proximity. PADP (Part-Aware Diffusion Policy) builds on this feature for imitation learning.

Result: PA3FF consistently outperforms 2D and 3D representations (CLIP, DINOv2, Grounded-SAM) in manipulation scenarios across simulated and real-world tasks. It also enables diverse downstream applications including correspondence learning and segmentation.

Conclusion: PA3FF provides a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation with part awareness, addressing key challenges in 3D feature representation and enabling better generalization in articulated object manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

### [37] [Muscle Coactivation in the Sky: Geometry and Pareto Optimality of Energy vs. Promptness in Multirotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14222)
*Antonio Franchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing the fundamental trade-off between energy economy and kinematic readiness (promptness) in aerial multirotors, using fiber-bundle theory to transform redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental tension between energy efficiency and kinematic readiness (agility) in aerial multirotors, recognizing that existing approaches often rely on heuristic tuning rather than principled understanding of this trade-off.

Method: The authors introduce a geometric fiber-bundle formulation that treats energy consumption and promptness as competing objectives. They use diffeomorphic transformation to linearize the signed-quadratic propulsion model, enabling rigorous study of cost interplay. The framework transforms redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers.

Result: Analysis reveals that the interplay between energy and promptness is fiber-dependent and shaped by hardware constraints. For unidirectional thrusters, feasible fibers are compact with interior allocations and short Pareto arcs, while torque demands break symmetry. With reversible propellers, null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operations, moving beyond heuristic tuning to principled optimization.

Abstract: In robotics and human biomechanics, the tension between energy economy and kinematic readiness is well recognized; this work brings that fundamental principle to aerial multirotors. We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation.

*Maria Conceição,António Grilo,Meysam Basiri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A path planning tool for sparse networked aerial robot teams that maximizes mission goals while enabling cooperation through communication-aware motion constraints and dynamic rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Networked aerial robot teams need cooperative behaviors for decentralized decision-making and resilience, especially with incomplete prior knowledge. Existing planning tools don't adequately address sparse connectivity, limited resources, and varying team compositions.

Method: Proposes SpArC-NART tool that simultaneously considers prior environmental information, agent energy/sensing/communication limits, and team constitutions. Uses communication model with radio technology constraints and physical phenomena. Cooperation mechanism employs soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on Value of Movement and expected communication availability.

Result: Developed tool demonstrated through ground sensing coverage use case, showing capabilities to maximize mission goals while reducing agent reporting times, increasing situational awareness, and facilitating mission replanning.

Conclusion: The SpArC-NART tool enables effective path planning for sparse networked aerial teams by integrating communication-aware cooperation mechanisms, improving mission efficiency and resilience in exploration missions with limited prior knowledge.

Abstract: A networked aerial robot team (NART) comprises a group of agents (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, etc.) interconnected by wireless links. Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool.

TL;DR: Latency-aware framework for deploying visuomotor policies on industrial robots addresses observation-execution gap through synchronized sensing, asynchronous inference-execution scheduling, and maintains performance under realistic timing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial robots face significant observation-execution latency gaps in contact-rich tasks due to high-level interfaces and slower dynamics, challenging deployment of learning-based visuomotor policies that require precise timing for reliable closed-loop control.

Method: Framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, unified communication pipeline, and teleoperation interface. Introduces latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures.

Result: Latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across varying inference latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in blocking and naive asynchronous baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit latency handling is critical for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots, with the proposed framework enabling robust performance under realistic timing constraints without requiring policy architecture modifications.

Abstract: Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in contact-rich construction and manufacturing tasks that involve uncertainty and long-horizon execution. While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effective autonomous tissue characterization with improved diagnostic capabilities, showing promise for clinical applications in tissue screening and pathology detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel autonomous robotic palpation framework for real-time elastic mapping during tissue exploration using a viscoelastic tissue model. The method combines force-based parameter estimation using a commercial force/torque sensor with an ergodic control strategy driven by a tailored Expected Information Density, which explicitly biases exploration toward diagnostically relevant regions by jointly considering model uncertainty, stiffness magnitude, and spatial gradients. An Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate viscoelastic model parameters online, while Gaussian Process Regression provides spatial modelling of the estimated elasticity, and a Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage controller enables adaptive, continuous trajectory planning. Simulations on synthetic stiffness maps demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better reconstruction accuracy, enhanced segmentation capability, and improved robustness in detecting stiff inclusions compared to Bayesian Optimisation-based techniques. Experimental validation on a silicone phantom with embedded inclusions emulating pathological tissue regions further corroborates the potential of the method for autonomous tissue characterisation in diagnostic and screening applications.

*Daniel Choate,Jason Rife*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vision-aided navigation pipeline for autonomous aircraft ground navigation that combines indirect methods' efficiency with direct image-based robustness, using SfM and ground plane mosaic matching to satellite imagery, demonstrating integrity features despite SfM drift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, certifiable vision-aided navigation solution for autonomous aircraft ground navigation that addresses the need for computational efficiency while maintaining solution integrity and robustness.

Method: Combines indirect methods' computational efficiency with direct image-based robustness. Processes ground images via feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM), constructs ground plane mosaic via homography transforms, and matches to satellite imagery using sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities.

Result: Experimental results show SfM solution drift (similar to dead-reckoning systems) challenges expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic. However, the algorithm demonstrates key integrity features: ability to identify registration anomalies and ambiguous matches.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline's integrity features can mitigate outlier behaviors and contribute toward a robust, certifiable solution for autonomous surface movement of aircraft, despite challenges with SfM drift in map-matching accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a vision-aided navigation (VAN) pipeline designed to support ground navigation of autonomous aircraft. The proposed algorithm combines the computational efficiency of indirect methods with the robustness of direct image-based techniques to enhance solution integrity. The pipeline starts by processing ground images (e.g., acquired by a taxiing aircraft) and relates them via a feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) solution. A ground plane mosaic is then constructed via homography transforms and matched to satellite imagery using a sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities. Experimental results reveal that drift within the SfM solution, similar to that observed in dead-reckoning systems, challenges the expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with a wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic. However, the proposed algorithm demonstrates key integrity features, such as the ability to identify registration anomalies and ambiguous matches. These characteristics of the pipeline can mitigate outlier behaviors and contribute toward a robust, certifiable solution for autonomous surface movement of aircraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior imitation learning approaches for humanoid loco-manipulation rely on human demonstrations and are brittle to disturbances, lacking robustness and requiring extensive teleoperation data.

Method: Three coupled components: recurrent object state estimator for tracking under occlusion, whole-body base policy with residual manipulation control, and LiDAR-based global position estimator. All trained via RL in simulation and deployed zero-shot.

Result: AdaptManip outperforms baseline methods (including imitation learning) in adaptability and success rate. Accurate object state estimation improves manipulation under occlusion. Demonstrated fully autonomous real-world navigation, lifting, and delivery.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust autonomous whole-body loco-manipulation without human demonstrations, with improved adaptability and success rates compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents Adaptive Whole-body Loco-Manipulation, AdaptManip, a fully autonomous framework for humanoid robots to perform integrated navigation, object lifting, and delivery. Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality.

Abstract: This study proposes an intelligent multi-agent framework built on LLMs and VLMs and specifically tailored to robotics. The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are employed in various scenarios in building construction. However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.

TL;DR: TWISTED-RL improves robotic knot-tying by replacing supervised inverse models with multi-step RL policies conditioned on topological actions, enabling better generalization and solving more complex knots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic knot-tying is challenging due to complex deformable object interactions and topological constraints. Previous approach TWISTED used demonstration-free decomposition but had limitations with single-step inverse models learned via supervised learning.

Method: Replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. Maintains the decomposition into manageable subproblems addressed by specialized agents.

Result: Solves previously unattainable knots of higher complexity (Figure-8, Overhand). Shows increased success rates and reduced planning time, establishing new state-of-the-art in demonstration-free robotic knot-tying.

Conclusion: TWISTED-RL's RL-based approach with topological action conditioning enables more delicate state transitions, avoids costly data collection, and achieves better generalization across diverse knot configurations.

Abstract: Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.

*Devodita Chakravarty,John Dolan,Yiwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical belief modeling with active probing and risk-aware control for safe autonomous driving in uncertain interactive scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat prediction-based planning and risk-aware control in isolation, limiting their ability to handle the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings, especially in uncertain scenarios where reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical belief model structuring human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes with Bayesian inference; develops an active probing strategy to identify multimodal ambiguity and plan disambiguating actions; implements a runtime risk-evaluation layer using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to ensure probing actions remain within human risk tolerance.

Result: Simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.

*Taichi Kato,Takuya Kiyokawa,Namiko Saito,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposed HRC framework with dual-correction mechanism (internal logical verification + external physical failure rectification) to address VLM hallucination and physical execution issues in human-robot collaborative assembly tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human instructions in HRC are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible robot behaviors. While VLMs help interpret instructions, they suffer from hallucinated reasoning and inability to anticipate physical execution failures.

Method: Augments VLM-based reasoning with dual-correction mechanism: 1) Internal correction model verifies logical consistency and task feasibility before execution; 2) External correction model detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback.

Result: Simulation ablation studies show improved success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks (object fixation, tool preparation by upper body humanoid robot) confirm effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with dual-correction mechanism effectively addresses VLM limitations and validates practical feasibility for interactive human-robot collaboration in assembly tasks.

Abstract: Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation-driven approach for automating the force-controlled assembly of electrical terminals on DIN-rails, a task traditionally hindered by high programming effort and product variability. The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential for agricultural applications requiring precise maneuvers in limited spaces. Classical methods like TEB planners are parameter-sensitive and require constant recalibration, while end-to-end DRL methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, leading to sub-optimal policies and poor generalization.

Method: ManeuverNet is a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems that combines Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. It introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning, without depending on expert data or handcrafted guidance.

Result: ManeuverNet achieves more than 40% gain over DRL baselines in maneuverability and success rates, effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity of TEB planners, and in real-world trials achieves up to 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency.

Conclusion: ManeuverNet demonstrates superior performance over both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and classical TEB planners, offering a robust and practical solution for autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots in agricultural applications without requiring expert data or constant parameter tuning.

Abstract: Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: SemFM enables robots to transfer demonstrated interactions from human videos to geometrically diverse objects by identifying semantic correspondences using functional maps, requiring only a single visual demonstration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LfD requires extensive physical demonstrations that are time-consuming and difficult to scale. While learning from human videos avoids direct robot involvement, a key challenge remains: generalizing demonstrated interactions across objects with similar functionality but different geometries.

Method: Semantic Anchored Functional Maps (SemFM) framework: 1) Starts with coarse mesh reconstruction from an image, 2) Identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, 3) Selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, 4) Propagates constraints over the surface using functional maps to obtain dense, semantically consistent correspondence for affordance transfer.

Result: Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making the approach suitable for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.

Conclusion: SemFM provides a lightweight, interpretable method for transferring demonstrated interactions across geometrically diverse objects from a single visual demonstration, addressing the generalization challenge in learning from human videos for robotics.

Abstract: Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.

*Balram Kandoria,Aryaman Singh Samyal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method using sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance to model AAM FMS architectures, achieving 76% accuracy in arrival time prediction for strategic flight plan validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AAM operations require strategic flight planning that accounts for spatial and temporal uncertainties against hazards like weather, restricted airspace, and CNS disruptions. Current methods use conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data, necessitating more accurate uncertainty estimation.

Method: Novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. The method continuously adapts measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, allowing FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. It scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions.

Result: Validated using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Parameters tuned on training set achieved 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against verification dataset, demonstrating effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation.

Conclusion: The proposed Kalman Filter-based method with sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance provides an effective approach for uncertainty propagation in AAM operations, enabling more accurate strategic flight plan validation compared to existing conservative linear models.

Abstract: Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) operations require strategic flight planning services that predict both spatial and temporal uncertainties to safely validate flight plans against hazards such as weather cells, restricted airspaces, and CNS disruption areas. Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.

*Mohanraj A,S Ganga Prasath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Scissor-unit assemblies with single-degree-of-freedom kinematics can be programmed for shape morphing and writing tasks using differentiable simulation and optimization, enabling automated navigation and inspection in complex domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how scissor-unit assemblies (two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint) with single-degree-of-freedom kinematics can be programmed for specific tasks, leveraging their geometric coupling for reproducible motion with minimal actuation.

Method: Derived expressions for effective curvature and tip trajectory as functions of geometric variables, then formulated shape morphing and writing tasks as optimization problems using differentiable simulation framework, with table-top experimental validation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated that scissor assembly geometry can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains through the optimization framework, with experimental validation of programmed tasks.

Conclusion: While scissor assemblies show promise for automated applications via geometric optimization, challenges remain in rapid programming and error-free experimental implementation without feedback systems.

Abstract: Kinematics of mechanisms is intricately coupled to their geometry and their utility often arises out of the ability to perform reproducible motion with fewer actuating degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PhyScensis is an LLM agent-based framework that uses a physics engine to generate physically plausible 3D scenes with complex object relationships for robotic manipulation training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior 3D scene generation methods focus on asset placement but neglect physical relationships (contact, support, balance, containment) needed for realistic manipulation scenarios like tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial/physical predicates, (2) physics-engine solver realizes predicates into 3D scenes, (3) feedback loop refines configurations. Uses probabilistic programming for stability and heuristics for stability/spatial regulation.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy. Provides unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts suitable for robotic manipulation training.

Conclusion: PhyScensis addresses limitations of classical 3D layout generation by modeling physical relationships, enabling creation of complex, physically plausible scenes essential for scaling robotic data collection in simulation.

Abstract: Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM0 is an embodied-native VLA framework for Physical AI that unifies manipulation and navigation through a three-stage pipeline with hybrid training and spatial reasoning scaffolding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches adapt internet-pretrained models to physical tasks as an afterthought, lacking native physical grounding. DM0 aims to create an embodied-native framework that learns physical priors from the onset by unifying manipulation and navigation with heterogeneous data sources.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Large-scale unified pretraining on VLM with diverse corpora (web text, autonomous driving, embodied logs); 2) Building flow-matching action expert atop VLM; 3) Hybrid training strategy where embodied data gradients don't backpropagate to VLM to preserve representations, while VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy constructs spatial Chain-of-Thought reasoning to constrain action space.

Result: DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on RoboChallenge benchmark in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.

Conclusion: DM0 demonstrates that an embodied-native approach with unified pretraining, hybrid training strategy, and spatial reasoning scaffolding enables superior physical AI performance compared to adaptation-based methods.

Abstract: Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RynnBrain is an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world dynamics through four core capabilities: egocentric understanding, spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The embodied intelligence community lacks a unified, physically grounded foundation model that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world spatial-temporal dynamics, despite rapid progress in multimodal foundation models.

Method: Developed a family of foundation models with three scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for specific tasks: RynnBrain-Nav (navigation), RynnBrain-Plan (planning), RynnBrain-VLA (vision-language-action), and RynnBrain-CoP (complex spatial reasoning).

Result: The models significantly outperform existing embodied foundation models on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks. The post-trained variants demonstrate capabilities for physically grounded reasoning and planning, and serve as efficient pretrained backbones for diverse embodied tasks.

Conclusion: RynnBrain successfully addresses the need for a unified spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence, demonstrating strong performance across multiple benchmarks and enabling physically grounded reasoning and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal foundation models, embodied intelligence community still lacks a unified, physically grounded foundation model that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world spatial-temporal dynamics. We introduce RynnBrain, an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence. RynnBrain strengthens four core capabilities in a unified framework: comprehensive egocentric understanding, diverse spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning. The RynnBrain family comprises three foundation model scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for downstream embodied tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-Nav, RynnBrain-Plan, and RynnBrain-VLA) or complex spatial reasoning tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-CoP). In terms of extensive evaluations on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks, our RynnBrain foundation models largely outperform existing embodied foundation models by a significant margin. The post-trained model suite further substantiates two key potentials of the RynnBrain foundation model: (i) enabling physically grounded reasoning and planning, and (ii) serving as a strong pretrained backbone that can be efficiently adapted to diverse embodied tasks.

### [60] [BPP: Long-Context Robot Imitation Learning by Focusing on Key History Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15010)
*Max Sobol Mark,Jacky Liang,Maria Attarian,Chuyuan Fu,Debidatta Dwibedi,Dhruv Shah,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BPP uses vision-language models to extract task-relevant keyframes from observation histories, reducing distribution shift and improving history-dependent robot policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot policies need history conditioning for tasks requiring memory (like searching rooms), but current methods fail due to spurious correlations from limited training history coverage, which grows exponentially with horizon.

Method: Big Picture Policies (BPP) uses vision-language models to detect minimal sets of meaningful keyframes from diverse rollouts, projecting histories onto compact task-relevant events to reduce distribution shift while maintaining expressivity.

Result: BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than best comparison methods on real-world evaluations across four challenging manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks requiring history conditioning.

Conclusion: By focusing on task-relevant keyframes rather than full histories, BPP effectively addresses the coverage problem in history-dependent robot policies, enabling robust generalization without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.

*Joyjit Roy,Samaresh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop AI system with adversarial self-critique reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy in commercial insurance underwriting while maintaining human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial insurance underwriting is labor-intensive and existing AI solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and reliability mechanisms for regulated, high-stakes environments where full automation is impractical and human accountability is critical.

Method: A decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system with adversarial self-critique mechanism where a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions before submission to human reviewers, plus development of a formal taxonomy of failure modes for risk management.

Result: Experimental evaluation on 500 expert-validated cases shows adversarial critique reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%, while maintaining strict human authority over binding decisions.

Conclusion: Adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable, addressing critical gaps in AI safety for regulated workflows.

Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.

TL;DR: BotzoneBench introduces a scalable evaluation framework that anchors LLM strategic reasoning assessment to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game AI, enabling linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability across diverse games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities in interactive environments, while current game-based evaluations using LLM-vs-LLM tournaments produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incur quadratic computational costs, and lack stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking.

Method: Anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game AI on the Botzone platform, evaluating LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games, systematically assessing 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models.

Result: Revealed significant performance disparities and identified distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains.

Conclusion: The anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities with linear-time absolute skill measurement and stable cross-temporal interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeRA is a framework that converts static benchmark problems into executable specifications to generate unlimited verified variants, addressing memorization and contamination issues in AI evaluation through two modes: equivalent rewriting (VeRA-E) and complexity hardening (VeRA-H).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation schemes suffer from static nature where the same problems are reused, enabling memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation, preventing genuine measurement of AI progress.

Method: VeRA converts benchmark problems into executable specifications with three components: natural language template with placeholders, coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates correct answers. It operates in two modes: VeRA-E (equivalent rewriting preserving logic) and VeRA-H (hardening by increasing complexity).

Result: Evaluation of 16 frontier models shows: (1) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns, (2) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels, (3) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm for robust evaluation.

Conclusion: VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enabling evaluation in any verifiable domain to scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity.

Abstract: The main issue with most evaluation schemes today is their "static" nature: the same problems are reused repeatedly, allowing for memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation. To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.
  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.
  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity. To stimulate future research, we have open-sourced all code and datasets.

*Bowen Liu,Zhi Wu,Runquan Xie,Zhanhui Kang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSLogic is an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales verifiable training signals for RLVR by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator-Validator program pairs, enabling continuous task-family evolution with controllable difficulty through a closed Generate-Validate-Repair loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling verifiable training signals is a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning provides a natural substrate due to formal constraints and programmatically checkable answers, but prior synthesis pipelines are limited by dependence on expert-written code or fixed templates that only allow instance-level perturbations.

Method: SSLogic employs an agentic meta-synthesis framework with a closed Generate-Validate-Repair loop. It iteratively synthesizes and repairs executable Generator-Validator program pairs. A Multi-Gate Validation Protocol combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks.

Result: Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expanded to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains: +5.2 on SynLogic, +1.4 on BBEH, +3.0 on AIME25, and +3.7 on Brumo25 over seed baseline at matched training steps.

Conclusion: SSLogic successfully scales verifiable training signals at the task-family level, enabling continuous evolution with controllable difficulty. The framework demonstrates significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, addressing the scaling bottleneck in RLVR through automated synthesis and validation of logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718).

### [66] [A Geometric Taxonomy of Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13224)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a taxonomy distinguishing three types of LLM hallucinations with different geometric signatures in embedding space, showing that only unfaithfulness and confabulation are detectable via embeddings while factual errors require external verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the ambiguous term "hallucination" in LLMs by distinguishing different phenomena with distinct geometric signatures in embedding space, enabling more precise detection approaches.

Method: Propose a taxonomy of three hallucination types: unfaithfulness, confabulation, and factual error. Analyze their geometric signatures in embedding space using AUROC detection metrics across domains, examining cosine similarities between discriminative directions.

Result: Type I (unfaithfulness) and II (confabulation) show domain-local detection (AUROC 0.76-0.99) but chance-level cross-domain detection (0.50). Human-crafted confabulations achieve 0.96 AUROC with minimal cross-domain degradation. Type III (factual errors) show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance, revealing theoretical limits of embedding-based detection.

Conclusion: The geometric taxonomy clarifies that embedding-based detection works for unfaithfulness and confabulation but fails for factual errors, which require external verification mechanisms since embeddings encode distributional patterns rather than correspondence to external reality.

Abstract: The term "hallucination" in large language models conflates distinct phenomena with different geometric signatures in embedding space. We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.

*Xuecong Li,Xiaohong Li,Qiang Hu,Yao Zhang,Junjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VaryBalance is a novel LLM-generated text detection method that exploits the greater difference between human texts and their LLM-rewritten versions compared to LLM-generated texts, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-generated text detectors have limitations: they rely on impractical white-box assumptions or only use text-level features, resulting in imprecise detection capabilities. There's a need for a more effective and practical detection method.

Method: VaryBalance leverages the observation that human texts show greater difference from their LLM-rewritten versions compared to LLM-generated texts. The method quantifies this difference using mean standard deviation to distinguish between human and LLM-generated texts.

Result: VaryBalance outperforms state-of-the-art detectors (Binoculars) by up to 34.3% in AUROC. It maintains robustness across multiple generating models and languages in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: VaryBalance provides a simple, effective, and practical solution for LLM-generated text detection that addresses limitations of existing methods while achieving superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial but challenging. Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and practical LLM-generated text detection method, VaryBalance. The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.

### [68] [Intelligence as Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13230)
*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization and Trap Escape Difficulty Index to explain intelligence stagnation as a geometric constraint in trajectory space rather than learning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why AI systems stagnate in long-horizon adaptability despite continued optimization, arguing this stems from structural properties of intelligence optimization rather than insufficient learning, data, or model capacity.

Method: Formulates intelligence as trajectory-level phenomenon with multi-objective trade-offs; introduces Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization (path-wise generalization of Pareto optimality); defines Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI) to measure escape constraints; develops taxonomy of Pareto traps; illustrates with minimal agent-environment model.

Result: Shows dynamic intelligence ceilings emerge as geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance independent of learning progress; demonstrates how Pareto traps restrict access to superior developmental paths; provides framework for diagnosing long-horizon constraints.

Conclusion: Shifts focus from terminal performance to optimization geometry, offering principled framework to understand and overcome developmental constraints in adaptive systems through trajectory-level analysis.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, many systems exhibit stagnation in long-horizon adaptability despite continued performance optimization. This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.

*Mingyang Liao,Yichen Wan,shuchen wu,Chenxi Miao,Xin Shen,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework improves jailbreak resistance in LLM role-playing without training, using attacker-defender cycles to build hierarchical safety knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM role-playing systems face a trade-off: stronger persona adherence increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. Training-based solutions are costly, degrade character fidelity, and are infeasible for closed-weight LLMs.

Method: Training-free framework with two coupled cycles: Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts; Role-Playing Defender Cycle builds hierarchical knowledge base (global safety rules, persona-grounded constraints, safe exemplars). At inference, Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge to guide generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent improvements over baselines in both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, with robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively addresses the safety-fidelity trade-off in LLM role-playing through adversarial self-evolution and hierarchical knowledge composition, offering a practical solution for evolving personas and attack strategies.

Abstract: LLM-based role-playing has rapidly improved in fidelity, yet stronger adherence to persona constraints commonly increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, especially for risky or negative personas. Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.

*Yuqi Xiong,Chunyi Peng,Zhipeng Xu,Zhenghao Liu,Zulong Chen,Yukun Yan,Shuo Wang,Yu Gu,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang2Act is a VRAG framework that uses self-emergent linguistic toolchains for fine-grained visual perception, replacing rigid external tools with RL-optimized action exploration and tool utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VRAG frameworks rely on rigid, pre-defined external tools that separate visual perception from reasoning, causing unnecessary visual information loss when operations like cropping are applied.

Method: Two-stage RL-based training: first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for building a reusable linguistic toolbox; second stage optimizes VLMs to effectively exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning.

Result: Lang2Act substantially enhances VLM visual perception capabilities, achieving performance improvements of over 4% compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed self-emergent linguistic toolchain approach effectively addresses limitations of decoupled VRAG designs, enabling more integrated and fine-grained visual perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

*Rizky Ramadhana Putra,Raihan Sultan Pasha Basuki,Yutong Cheng,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2LOGIC is a framework that improves natural language to first-order logic translation using abstract syntax trees as intermediate representation, achieving near-perfect syntactic accuracy and significant semantic correctness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for translating natural language to first-order logic (like GCD and CODE4LOGIC) suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness from insufficient clause-level semantic understanding, limiting their effectiveness in critical domains like law and governance.

Method: NL2LOGIC introduces an abstract syntax tree as intermediate representation, combining a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code.

Result: On FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks, NL2LOGIC achieves 99% syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30% over state-of-the-art baselines. Integration into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31% compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.

Conclusion: NL2LOGIC effectively addresses the limitations of existing natural language to first-order logic translation methods by using abstract syntax trees as intermediate representation, significantly improving both syntactic accuracy and semantic faithfulness for automated reasoning applications.

Abstract: Automated reasoning is critical in domains such as law and governance, where verifying claims against facts in documents requires both accuracy and interpretability. Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.

*Roham Koohestani,Ali Al-Kaswan,Jonathan Katzy,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AST-PAC improves membership inference for code LLMs by using AST-based perturbations instead of generic augmentations, showing better performance on large, syntactically complex files but underperforming on small or alphanumeric-rich code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code LLMs are trained on restrictively licensed source code, creating copyright and governance challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can audit unauthorized data usage, but existing methods like PAC use augmentations that disregard code syntax, limiting effectiveness.

Method: The study evaluates Loss Attack and Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) on 3B-7B parameter code models. Introduces AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples.

Result: PAC generally outperforms Loss baseline but degrades on larger, complex files due to syntax-disregarding augmentations. AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows (where PAC degrades) but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code.

Conclusion: Findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as prerequisites for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: X-Blocks: A hierarchical framework analyzing natural language explanations for automated vehicles across context, syntax, and lexical levels, with RACE achieving 91.45% accuracy for scenario-aware classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analyzing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios, limiting trust and acceptance of automated vehicles through natural language explanations.

Method: X-Blocks framework with three analytical levels: 1) Context level using RACE (multi-LLM ensemble with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and self-consistency) for 32 scenario-aware categories; 2) Lexical level using log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors; 3) Syntactic level using dependency parsing and template extraction.

Result: RACE achieves 91.45% accuracy and Cohen's kappa of 0.91 against human annotator agreement cases; reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns and limited repertoire of reusable grammar families with systematic variation across contexts.

Conclusion: X-Blocks provides dataset-agnostic, task-independent framework offering evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a critical role in establishing trust and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), yet existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analysing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios. This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.
  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.
  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.
  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.

*Najmul Hasan,Prashanth BusiReddyGari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DPBench is a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination under resource contention, revealing LLMs fail catastrophically in simultaneous decision-making scenarios despite working well in sequential settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, but there's a lack of benchmarks testing their ability to coordinate under resource contention, particularly in scenarios requiring concurrent resource access.

Method: DPBench uses the Dining Philosophers problem to evaluate LLM coordination across eight conditions varying decision timing (sequential vs. simultaneous), group size, and communication. Tests were conducted with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1.

Result: LLMs show striking asymmetry: they coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail catastrophically in simultaneous decision-making, with deadlock rates exceeding 95% under some conditions. Communication doesn't resolve the problem and can even increase deadlock rates. The failure is traced to convergent reasoning where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that guarantee deadlock when executed simultaneously.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination.

TL;DR: MAPLE decomposes LLM agent personalization into three distinct components (Memory, Learning, Personalization) instead of treating them as unified capabilities, achieving significant improvements in adaptation to individual users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents have limited ability to adapt to individual users because they conflate memory, learning, and personalization as a single capability rather than recognizing them as three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, timescales, and optimization approaches.

Method: Proposes MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where: 1) Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; 2) Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; 3) Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces.

Result: Experimental evaluation on MAPLE-Personas benchmark shows: 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95); trait incorporation rate increased from 45% to 75%; enables agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

Conclusion: Decomposing personalization into distinct memory, learning, and personalization components with specialized infrastructure and interfaces significantly improves LLM agents' ability to adapt to individual users, addressing a fundamental architectural limitation in current systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving language model performance with additional test-time computation (serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling) are compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets, creating a need for more efficient allocation strategies.

Method: SELFCEST equips a base model with ability to spawn same-weight clones in parallel contexts through agentic reinforcement learning. Training is end-to-end under global task reward with shared-parameter rollouts, learning a controller that allocates both generation and context budget across branches.

Result: SELFCEST improves accuracy-cost Pareto frontier relative to monolithic baselines at matched inference budget across challenging math reasoning benchmarks and long-context multi-hop QA, and exhibits out-of-distribution generalization in both domains.

Conclusion: The proposed SELFCEST framework provides an effective approach for optimizing test-time computation allocation through learned parallel branching, offering improved efficiency and generalization capabilities for language models under constrained inference budgets.

Abstract: Frontier language models improve with additional test-time computation, but serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling can be compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets.

Motivation: Increasing cyber-threat complexity demands intrusion detection systems that are both accurate and interpretable, requiring transparency in deep learning models for security analysts to understand and validate decisions.

Method: Integrated CNN and LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in traffic sequences, combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, evaluated on NSL-KDD dataset with trust-focused expert survey using IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits.

Result: Both CNN and LSTM achieved 0.99 accuracy; LSTM outperformed CNN in macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score; both performed similarly on weighted averages; SHAP identified key influential features; expert survey validated system reliability and usability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines performance and transparency in cybersecurity, demonstrating the potential of XAI-enhanced IDS, with recommendations for future adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

Motivation: To address the unclear distinction between genuine temporal understanding versus contextual/event-driven reasoning in forecasting models, and to provide diagnostic analysis of temporal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces TemporalBench with a four-tier task taxonomy: historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems domains.

Result: Extensive baseline experiments show strong numerical forecasting accuracy doesn't reliably translate to robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; existing frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks.

Conclusion: TemporalBench enables diagnostic evaluation of temporal reasoning capabilities, revealing limitations in current models and providing a public benchmark dataset and leaderboard for further research.

Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent AI systems should adopt institutional design principles (compartmentalization, adversarial review) rather than relying solely on individual alignment to achieve reliable collective behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human institutions achieve reliable collective behavior through organizational structure that mitigates risks from misaligned individuals, suggesting multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model rather than assuming perfect individual alignment.

Method: Developed Perseverance Composition Engine with three specialized agents: Composer drafts text, Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with source access, and Critic evaluates argumentative quality without source access (enforced information asymmetry). This creates layered verification through architectural design.

Result: Analysis of 474 composition tasks showed patterns consistent with institutional hypothesis. When given impossible tasks requiring fabrication, the system progressed from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals—behavior not individually instructed or incentivized.

Conclusion: Organizational theory provides a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. Architectural enforcement through information compartmentalization offers a route to reliable collective behavior from unreliable individual components, positioning institutional design as a viable approach to AI safety.

Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.

*Hanchen David Wang,Clayton Cohn,Zifan Xu,Siyuan Guo,Gautam Biswas,Meiyi Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAGLE is a neuro-symbolic framework that simulates authentic student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning theory to overcome LLMs' competency bias toward efficient correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting authentic student learning data is challenging due to privacy concerns and high costs of longitudinal studies. While LLMs offer promise for student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners.

Method: BEAGLE integrates three key innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model governing timing and transitions of cognitive and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; (3) a decoupled agent design separating high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent silent error correction.

Result: BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories on Python programming tasks. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving 52.8% accuracy (indistinguishable from random guessing).

Conclusion: BEAGLE successfully addresses LLMs' competency bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning theory, enabling realistic simulation of novice learning behaviors with applications in training adaptive tutoring systems and stress-testing pedagogical interventions.

Abstract: Simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving environments holds potential for education research, from training adaptive tutoring systems to stress-testing pedagogical interventions. However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%).

### [82] [Accuracy Standards for AI at Work vs. Personal Life: Evidence from an Online Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13283)
*Gaston Besanson,Federico Todeschini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People demand higher AI accuracy at work than in personal life, with work disruptions being less severe when AI tools are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable.

Method: Online survey (N=300) measuring accuracy requirements and disruption experiences in work vs. personal contexts, with statistical analysis of differences and correlations.

Result: Significantly higher accuracy requirements at work (24.1% top-box vs. 8.8% personal), with heavy app users having stricter work standards. More disruption reported in personal routines (34.1%) than at work (15.3%) when tools are unavailable.

Conclusion: Context matters significantly for AI accuracy expectations, with professional settings demanding higher reliability, while personal use shows greater disruption when AI tools are unavailable.

Abstract: We study how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts for adoption purposes, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable. Because modern AI systems (especially generative models) can produce acceptable but non-identical outputs, we define "accuracy" as context-specific reliability: the degree to which an output aligns with the user's intent within a tolerance threshold that depends on stakes and the cost of correction. In an online survey (N=300), among respondents with both accuracy items (N=170), the share requiring high accuracy (top-box) is 24.1% at work vs. 8.8% in personal life (+15.3 pp; z=6.29, p<0.001). The gap remains large under a broader top-two-box definition (67.0% vs. 32.9%) and on the full 1-5 ordinal scale (mean 3.86 vs. 3.08). Heavy app use and experience patterns correlate with stricter work standards (H2). When tools are unavailable (H3), respondents report more disruption in personal routines than at work (34.1% vs. 15.3%, p<0.01). We keep the main text focused on these substantive results and place test taxonomy and power derivations in a technical appendix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mirror is an AI framework for ethics review that combines ethical reasoning models with structured rule interpretation and multi-agent deliberation to improve review quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethics review systems face strain from large-scale interdisciplinary research, creating demand for consistent decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles. Current LLMs lack sufficient ethical reasoning, regulatory integration, and privacy compliance for direct application to authentic review materials.

Method: Developed Mirror framework with EthicsLLM (fine-tuned on EthicsQA dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples) and two operational modes: Mirror-ER for automated expedited review using executable rule base, and Mirror-CR for full-board deliberation simulation with coordinated expert agents across ten ethical dimensions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Mirror significantly improves quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared to strong generalist LLMs.

Conclusion: Mirror provides a unified AI-assisted framework that addresses limitations of current ethics review systems through integrated ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation, offering scalable support for research governance.

Abstract: Ethics review is a foundational mechanism of modern research governance, yet contemporary systems face increasing strain as ethical risks arise as structural consequences of large-scale, interdisciplinary scientific practice. The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.

*Daesik Jang,Morgan Lindsay Heisler,Linzi Xing,Yifei Li,Edward Wang,Ying Xiong,Yong Zhang,Zhenan Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DECKBench is a benchmark for evaluating multi-agent slide generation and editing systems, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods for academic presentation creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately measure the complex requirements of academic slide generation and editing, including faithful content selection, coherent organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following.

Method: Developed DECKBench evaluation framework with curated paper-to-slide dataset augmented with simulated editing instructions, plus a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes tasks into paper parsing/summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing.

Result: The benchmark successfully highlights system strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems.

Conclusion: DECKBench establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing systems.

Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Situation Graph Prediction (SGP) as a task for modeling perspective states through inverse inference from multimodal artifacts, using synthetic data generation to overcome privacy and labeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perspective-aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states (goals, emotions, contexts), but faces data bottlenecks: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled.

Method: Proposes Situation Graph Prediction (SGP) task framing perspective modeling as inverse inference. Uses structure-first synthetic generation strategy aligning latent labels and observable traces by design. Conducts diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as supervision proxy.

Result: Study with GPT-4o shows gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference, indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under controlled settings. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for structure-first data synthesis strategy.

Conclusion: SGP presents a promising approach for perspective modeling despite challenges, with structure-first synthetic data generation offering a viable path forward for training perspective-aware AI systems without privacy-compromising real data.

Abstract: Perspective-Aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states--goals, emotions, contexts--not merely preferences. Progress is limited by a data bottleneck: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled. We propose Situation Graph Prediction (SGP), a task that frames perspective modeling as an inverse inference problem: reconstructing structured, ontology-aligned representations of perspective from observable multimodal artifacts. To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for the structure-first data synthesis strategy.

*Flint Xiaofeng Fan,Cheston Tan,Roger Wattenhofer,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Theoretical framework shows AI agent tool errors accumulate linearly with O(√T) deviations, enabling predictable system behavior and actionable deployment principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-powered agents increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, understanding how errors propagate across sequential tool calls is critical for reliability.

Method: Developed first theoretical framework for error accumulation in MCP agents using hybrid distortion metric (discrete fact matching + continuous semantic similarity), established martingale concentration bounds, and validated across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B.

Result: Proved cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth with O(√T) high-probability deviations, semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80%, and periodic re-grounding every ~9 steps suffices for error control.

Conclusion: The concentration guarantees enable predictable system behavior without exponential failure modes, providing actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

### [87] [Detecting Jailbreak Attempts in Clinical Training LLMs Through Automated Linguistic Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13321)
*Tri Nguyen,Huy Hoang Bao Le,Lohith Srikanth Pentapalli,Laurah Turner,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated jailbreak detection system for clinical LLMs that uses BERT-based models to extract linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction) and combines them with various classifiers to identify unsafe user behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on clinical LLM jailbreak detection relied on manually annotated linguistic features, which limited scalability and expressiveness. The authors aim to develop a more scalable and automated approach using LLM-derived features.

Method: 1) Use expert annotations of four core linguistic features; 2) Train BERT-based models (both general-domain and medical-domain) to predict these features from text; 3) Select best feature regressors for each dimension; 4) Use extracted features in a second layer of classifiers (tree-based, linear, probabilistic, ensemble methods) to determine jailbreak likelihood.

Result: The system achieves strong overall performance across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, demonstrating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection in clinical dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems, while identifying limitations in current annotations and feature representations that point toward future improvements including richer annotation schemes and finer-grained feature extraction.

Abstract: Detecting jailbreak attempts in clinical training large language models (LLMs) requires accurate modeling of linguistic deviations that signal unsafe or off-task user behavior. Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems.

### [88] [Contrastive explanations of BDI agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13323)
*Michael Winikoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends BDI agent explanation capabilities to answer contrastive questions ("why X instead of Y?"), finding they produce shorter explanations and may improve trust and understanding compared to non-contrastive explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems need explanation capabilities for transparency and trust development. While prior work enabled BDI agents to answer "why X?" questions, humans naturally ask contrastive questions ("why X instead of Y?"), creating a gap in explanation capabilities.

Method: Extends previous BDI agent explanation framework to handle contrastive questions. Conducts computational evaluation comparing explanation lengths, and human subject evaluation assessing preference, trust development, transparency, and understanding.

Result: Contrastive questions yield significantly shorter explanations. Some evidence shows contrastive answers are preferred and lead to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in system correctness. Surprisingly, providing full explanations sometimes performed worse than no explanations.

Conclusion: Contrastive explanations are more efficient and potentially more effective for trust development than non-contrastive ones. However, the benefit of providing explanations at all is not clear-cut, suggesting explanation design requires careful consideration of context and user needs.

Abstract: The ability of autonomous systems to provide explanations is important for supporting transparency and aiding the development of (appropriate) trust. Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nanbeige4.1-3B is a 3B parameter unified language model achieving strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning, outperforming similar-scale models and even some larger models through innovative reward modeling and training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create the first open-source small language model (3B parameters) that simultaneously achieves versatility across agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning, demonstrating that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization.

Method: Combines point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling for reasoning and preference alignment; uses complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning for code generation; performs complex data synthesis with turn-level supervision for deep search; enables stable long-horizon tool interactions (up to 600 tool-call turns).

Result: Significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale (Nanbeige4-3B-2511, Qwen3-4B) and achieves superior performance compared to much larger models (Qwen3-30B-A3B); demonstrates reliable execution of up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving.

Conclusion: Small models (3B parameters) can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of small language models through innovative training techniques and reward modeling approaches.

Abstract: We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.

Motivation: Address the critical challenge of evaluating moral alignment in AI agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science.

Method: Introduces Morality Chains (ordered deontic constraints for moral norms) and MoralityGym (98 ethical-dilemma problems as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments), decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation with a novel Morality Metric.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for developing AI systems that behave more reliably, transparently, and ethically in complex real-world contexts by integrating insights from psychology and philosophy into norm-sensitive reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating moral alignment in agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms is a critical challenge at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science.

By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: On-policy SFT simplifies RL-based reasoning model training by replacing complex multi-reward objectives with supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for correctness and conciseness, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for training large reasoning models use complex multi-reward objectives to optimize both correctness and brevity, but these extensions destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. The authors challenge the necessity of this complexity and identify fundamental misalignments in the existing paradigm.

Method: The authors simplify the training objective by removing KL regularization and group-wise normalization, reducing the reward to a truncation-based length penalty. This transforms the optimization problem into supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness, termed "on-policy SFT."

Result: On-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, reducing chain-of-thought length by up to 80% while maintaining original accuracy. It surpasses more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks, reduces GPU memory usage by 50%, and accelerates convergence by 70%.

Conclusion: The proposed on-policy SFT demonstrates that simpler supervised fine-tuning on carefully filtered self-generated data can outperform complex RL-based approaches for training large reasoning models, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT.

*Guoan Wang,Shihao Yang,Jun-En Ding,Hao Zhu,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroWeaver is an autonomous evolutionary agent for EEG analysis that reformulates pipeline engineering as constrained optimization, using domain-informed initialization and multi-objective evolution to create lightweight, scientifically plausible solutions that match foundation model performance with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for EEG analysis require substantial data and high parameterization, leading to prohibitive computational costs that hinder deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. General-purpose AutoML frameworks are unsuitable because they explore unbounded programmatic spaces without incorporating neurophysiological priors, often producing scientifically implausible solutions.

Method: NeuroWeaver reformulates EEG pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. It employs Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine searches to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, combined with Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency through self-reflective refinement.

Result: Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks show that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: NeuroWeaver addresses the limitations of both foundation models and general AutoML for EEG analysis by providing a unified autonomous evolutionary approach that generates scientifically plausible, computationally efficient solutions while maintaining high performance across diverse EEG datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies security vulnerabilities in multi-agent LLM systems, particularly the orchestrator pattern, demonstrating a novel attack vector called OMNI-LEAK that bypasses data access controls through indirect prompt injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multi-agent LLM systems become practical, there's insufficient threat modeling for their security vulnerabilities, with prior work focusing mainly on single-agent systems lacking basic engineering safeguards like access control.

Method: Red-teaming a representative orchestrator setup (central agent delegating to specialized agents) to identify vulnerabilities, testing frontier models with different attack categories, and demonstrating OMNI-LEAK attack that compromises multiple agents through single indirect prompt injection.

Result: Both reasoning and non-reasoning frontier models are vulnerable to OMNI-LEAK attacks that leak sensitive data despite access controls, even without attacker knowledge of implementation details.

Conclusion: Safety research must generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings to address serious risks of privacy breaches, financial losses, and erosion of public trust in AI agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve nutritional quality of meals without compromising convenience or affordability, addressing the gap between dietary guidelines and practical meal planning.

Method: Used WWEIA intake data for 135,491 meals to identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes, then conditioned a generative model and portion predictor on these archetypes to meet USDA nutritional targets with minimal food substitutions.

Result: Generated meals achieved 47.0% better RDI target compliance while remaining compositionally close to real meals. With 1-3 food substitutions, meals became 10% more nutritious while reducing costs by 19-32% on average.

Conclusion: The framework successfully translates dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals through simple swaps, enabling scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition for clinical, public health, and consumer applications.

Abstract: An important goal for personalized diet systems is to improve nutritional quality without compromising convenience or affordability. We present an end-to-end framework that converts dietary standards into complete meals with minimal change. Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.

### [95] [SPILLage: Agentic Oversharing on the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13516)
*Jaechul Roh,Eugene Bagdasarian,Hamed Haddadi,Ali Shahin Shamsabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPILLage framework reveals web agents frequently overshare user information through both content (text) and behavioral (clicks, navigation) channels, with behavioral oversharing being 5x more prevalent than content oversharing, and reducing oversharing improves task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered web agents automate user tasks across the open web with access to sensitive user resources, but unlike controlled chatbot settings, they interact with third parties and leave action traces, raising concerns about unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information.

Method: Introduces SPILLage framework characterizing oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). Benchmarks 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes, conducting 1,080 runs across two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs.

Result: Oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominating content oversharing by 5x. The effect persists and can worsen under prompt-level mitigation, but removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%.

Conclusion: Protecting privacy in web agents requires a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web (behavioral traces) not just what they type, and reducing oversharing actually improves task success rather than hindering it.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

*Yiheng Shu,Saisri Padmaja Jonnalagedda,Xiang Gao,Bernal Jiménez Gutiérrez,Weijian Qi,Kamalika Das,Huan Sun,Yu Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMem is a two-phase episodic memory framework for language agents that constructs hybrid memory graphs from experiences and performs agentic retrieval with reasoning tools, achieving state-of-the-art performance on episodic recollection and reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language agents lack effective episodic memory capabilities - they mainly use semantic memory and cannot properly recollect and reason over interaction histories like humans do. Existing approaches overlook episodicity, lack explicit event modeling, or focus too much on simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Offline indexing converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph linking time-aware gists and facts; 2) Online inference uses an agentic retriever with curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph.

Result: REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems (Mem0 and HippoRAG 2) with 3.4% absolute improvement on episodic recollection tasks and 13.4% on episodic reasoning tasks. It also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

Conclusion: REMem successfully addresses the episodic memory gap in language agents through its hybrid memory graph construction and agentic retrieval approach, enabling effective recollection and reasoning over interaction histories.

Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpAgent: An online RL-based web agent that achieves 71.6% SOTA success on WebArena through hierarchical multi-task fine-tuning, online agentic RL with hybrid rewards, and modular operator framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous web agents face complexity and volatility of real-world websites. Conventional SFT and offline RL methods suffer from severe distributional shifts as offline trajectories fail to capture stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback in unconstrained web environments.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning with datasets categorized by Planning, Acting, and Grounding primitives; 2) Online Agentic RL with Hybrid Reward Mechanism combining WebJudge (ground-truth-agnostic holistic assessment) and Rule-based Decision Tree (progress reward); 3) Operator Agent (OpAgent) modular framework orchestrating Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer for error recovery and self-correction.

Result: RL-enhanced model achieves 38.1% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. OpAgent framework elevates performance to new SOTA success rate of 71.6%.

Conclusion: The proposed online RL approach with hierarchical fine-tuning, hybrid rewards, and modular operator framework effectively addresses distributional shift problems and achieves state-of-the-art performance in autonomous web navigation tasks.

Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.

*Anooshka Bajaj,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show human-expert bias: they conform more to responses labeled as coming from human experts than to other LLMs, even when the expert signal is incorrect, demonstrating credibility-sensitive social influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly operate in social environments with inputs from other agents, tools, or humans. The paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit patterns of social influence similar to humans, particularly whether they privilege human feedback over LLM feedback.

Method: Three binary decision-making tasks (reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, moral judgment) with four instruction-tuned LLMs. Presented prior responses attributed to friends, human experts, or other LLMs, manipulating correctness and group size. Second experiment introduced direct disagreement between single human and single LLM.

Result: Models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when incorrect, and revise answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. Expert framing acts as strong prior across decision domains.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit credibility-sensitive social influence with human-expert bias, suggesting they internalize social credibility cues similar to humans, with implications for LLM deployment in social contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.

TL;DR: A novel differentiable ILP framework integrates self-supervised clustering to learn interpretable rules directly from raw data without explicit label leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable ILP models struggle with learning directly from raw data due to explicit label leakage—the inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels.

Method: Integration of a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model to enable rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage.

Result: The method learns generalized rules from time series and image data, effectively describing raw data through its features with intuitive and precise results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses explicit label leakage in differentiable ILP, enabling interpretable rule learning directly from raw data while maintaining scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent proof sprint workflow combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification and targeted repair, applied to ten research problems with heterogeneous outcomes and explicit status tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a structured methodology for accelerating mathematical research through coordinated multi-agent collaboration, addressing the challenge of reliable verification in compressed proof sprints while maintaining explicit provenance and status tracking.

Method: Uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Combines rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance tracking. Employs structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies.

Result: Heterogeneous outcomes across ten problems: Problem 3 has validation-complete existence path; Problem 5 solved for scope-limited form; Problem 10 conditional with explicit counterexamples; Problems 4 and 6 partial with named obligations; Problem 7 provisionally closed pending re-check. QC layer shows Problems 7 and 9 have node-level validation but unresolved verifier gaps.

Conclusion: Structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints. The methodology enables explicit distinction between mathematical status and QC-validation status, providing a framework for accelerated collaborative research with transparent outcome tracking.

Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hippocampus is an agentic memory system using binary signatures and token-ID streams with Dynamic Wavelet Matrix compression for ultra-fast semantic search and exact content reconstruction, achieving 31× lower latency and 14× lower token footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems need persistent memory for user histories beyond LLM context windows, but existing approaches using dense vector databases or knowledge graphs suffer from high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability.

Method: Uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction, with a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to enable ultra-fast search in the compressed domain.

Result: Reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31×, cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14×, while maintaining accuracy on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks. Scales linearly with memory size.

Conclusion: Hippocampus provides a scalable, high-performance memory management system for agentic AI that overcomes limitations of existing dense-vector and graph-based approaches through innovative compression and indexing techniques.

Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

### [102] [The Quantization Trap: Breaking Linear Scaling Laws in Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13595)
*Henry Han,Xiyang Liu,Xiaodong Wang,Fei Han,Xiaodong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural scaling laws break for multi-hop reasoning due to a "quantization trap" where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases net energy consumption while degrading accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the conventional neural scaling law assumption that reducing numerical precision linearly improves computational efficiency and energy profile (E ∝ bits). The motivation is to investigate why this scaling breaks down specifically for multi-hop reasoning tasks, where industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic may be counterproductive.

Method: The authors demonstrate the quantization trap phenomenon through empirical evidence showing increased energy consumption and degraded accuracy when reducing precision. They provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition attributing the failure to: 1) hardware casting overhead, 2) hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels that becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, and 3) sequential energy amortization failure.

Result: The results show that scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice for multi-hop reasoning tasks. Reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy, creating a quantization trap that makes the conventional scaling law inapplicable.

Conclusion: The industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks. The findings suggest that neural scaling laws do not hold for multi-hop reasoning due to fundamental bottlenecks in hardware casting overhead and dequantization kernel latency that dominate in sequential reasoning chains.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: DiffusionRollout is a selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models that uses predictive uncertainty to adaptively select step sizes, reducing error accumulation in long-horizon PDE predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by PDEs using autoregressive diffusion models, where conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs leads to compounding errors over time.

Method: Proposes DiffusionRollout, which leverages the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to quantify predictive uncertainty through standard deviations computed over multiple samples. Uses this uncertainty measure as a proxy for predictive confidence to adaptively select step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, reducing conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs.

Result: Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks shows the proposed uncertainty measure is strongly correlated with prediction errors, and the adaptive planning strategy achieves lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories with high correlation to ground truths.

Conclusion: DiffusionRollout effectively mitigates error accumulation in long-horizon PDE predictions by using uncertainty quantification to guide adaptive rollout planning, improving the reliability of autoregressive diffusion models for physical system forecasting.

Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.

TL;DR: A novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents with agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization that reduces computational costs and enables efficient autonomous GUI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents face non-stationary environments in real-world applications, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. Current MLLM-driven approaches need more efficient methods for stable learning in dynamic GUI environments.

Method: Two-component framework: (1) Agentic-Q estimation optimizes a Q-model to generate step-wise values evaluating action contributions to task completion; (2) Step-wise policy optimization takes state-action trajectory samples as inputs and optimizes policy via reinforcement learning using the agentic-Q model. The framework ensures manageable data collection costs by using policy-generated trajectories and decouples policy updates from the environment for stable optimization.

Result: The framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks, surpassing larger-scale contenders.

Conclusion: The proposed MLLM-centered framework provides an efficient solution for GUI agents in non-stationary environments, reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance through agentic-Q estimation and decoupled policy optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.

### [105] [HyFunc: Accelerating LLM-based Function Calls for Agentic AI through Hybrid-Model Cascade and Dynamic Templating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13665)
*Weibin Liao,Jian-guang Lou,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyFunc is a framework that reduces inference latency in agentic AI systems by eliminating three types of computational redundancies in LLM-based function calling through hybrid-model cascades and dynamic templating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems using LLMs for function calling suffer from high inference latency due to computational redundancies: processing large function libraries for every request, using large models for predictable token sequences, and generating boilerplate parameter syntax.

Method: HyFunc uses a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token" that guides a lightweight retriever for function selection and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model for final call generation. It also employs "dynamic templating" to inject boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine.

Result: HyFunc achieves 0.828 seconds inference latency (outperforming all baselines) and 80.1% performance on the unseen BFCL benchmark dataset, surpassing all models with comparable parameter scale while maintaining excellent efficiency-performance balance.

Conclusion: HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI by systematically eliminating computational redundancies in LLM-based function calling while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token." This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our "dynamic templating" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AllMem is a hybrid architecture combining Sliding Window Attention with non-linear Test-Time Training memory networks to enable LLMs to efficiently handle ultra-long contexts while reducing computational/memory costs and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to computational complexity and memory overhead of self-attention, along with issues of catastrophic forgetting and representation constraints in linear memory models.

Method: Integrates Sliding Window Attention with non-linear Test-Time Training memory networks; implements Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning to replace standard attention layers with memory-augmented sliding window layers; enables transformation of any pre-trained LLM into AllMem architecture.

Result: 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with only 0.83 drop vs full attention; 8k window variant outperforms full attention on InfiniteBench at 128k context; validates effectiveness of parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling.

Conclusion: AllMem provides an efficient framework for scaling LLMs to ultra-long contexts while overcoming computational/memory limitations of traditional attention, enabling practical long-sequence inference without prohibitive costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.

*Yu Li,Guangfeng Cai,Shengtian Yang,Han Luo,Shuo Han,Xu He,Dong Li,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhGPO improves LLM agent tool planning by learning reusable transition patterns from historical successful trajectories, similar to ant colony optimization pheromones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon multi-step tool planning suffers from combinatorial explosion, and current approaches treat successful tool-use paths as immediate rewards without extracting reusable information for subsequent training.

Method: Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO) learns trajectory-based transition patterns (pheromone) from historical trajectories and uses this learned pheromone to guide policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions.

Result: Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PhGPO in improving long-horizon tool planning.

Conclusion: Historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns that can be leveraged throughout training via pheromone-guided optimization, addressing combinatorial explosion in long-horizon tool planning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.

TL;DR: LLMs integrated into an automated citation-verification pipeline can solve research-grade mathematical problems, with verified solutions submitted to official organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at competition-level math benchmarks and auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored.

Method: Integrate next-generation LLMs (Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro) into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification to solve sophisticated research problems.

Result: Pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in ICCM sets and "First Proof" set; solutions for first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of "First Proof" set fully verified; all proofs submitted to official organizations.

Conclusion: LLMs with optimized automated pipelines can effectively solve research-grade mathematical problems, demonstrating practical deployment potential beyond competition benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.

### [109] [No Need to Train Your RDB Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13697)
*Linjie Xu,Yanlin Zhang,Quan Gan,Minjie Wang,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel RDB foundation model that enables in-context learning across multiple relational tables without retraining, using column-wise compression and SQL-based encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational databases contain vast heterogeneous tabular data, but existing approaches require retraining models for each new prediction target. Foundation models with in-context learning offer a solution but are limited to single tables. The challenge is generalizing to multiple interrelated tables while avoiding retraining.

Method: Proposes a principled RDB encoder that compresses variably-sized database neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples using column-wise compression within homogeneous columns (not across heterogeneous columns). The encoder uses scalable SQL primitives without trainable parameters, allowing seamless pairing with existing single-table ICL foundation models.

Result: Developed an open-source RDB foundation model (RDBLearn) that achieves robust performance on unseen datasets without training or fine-tuning. Theoretical and empirical evidence shows that column-wise compression outperforms cross-column compression for ICL.

Conclusion: A practical, training-free approach for RDB foundation models that generalizes in-context learning to multiple tables through principled column-wise compression and SQL-based encoding, enabling out-of-the-box performance on diverse relational databases.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.

*Bo Lv,Yasheng Sun,Junjie Wang,Haoxiang Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneLatent compresses chain-of-thought reasoning into a single latent token using supervision from rendered CoT images and OCR hidden states, achieving 11× output length reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning but significantly increases inference costs (1-2 orders of magnitude). There's a need to maintain reasoning benefits while reducing computational overhead and output verbosity.

Method: Render textual reasoning steps into images, then compress intermediate reasoning into a single latent token using supervision from these rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states. This provides deterministic, auditable supervision without verbose textual output.

Result: 11× average output length reduction with only 2.21% average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT; 6.8× improvement in output token contribution (OTC); 99.80% accuracy on ProntoQA and 97.80% on ProsQA with one latent token; up to 87.4× compression on long-chain reasoning.

Conclusion: OneLatent effectively compresses reasoning while maintaining performance, enabling efficient inference with minimal accuracy trade-offs and supporting compression-constrained generalization for long-chain logical reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often increases inference cost by one to two orders of magnitude. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{OneLatent}, a framework that compresses intermediate reasoning into a single latent token via supervision from rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states. By rendering textual steps into images, we obtain a deterministic supervision signal that can be inspected and audited without requiring the model to output verbose textual rationales. Across benchmarks, OneLatent reduces average output length by $11\times$ with only a $2.21\%$ average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT, while improving output token contribution (OTC) by $6.8\times$. On long-chain logical reasoning, OneLatent reaches $99.80\%$ on ProntoQA and $97.80\%$ on ProsQA with one latent token, with compression up to $87.4\times$, supporting compression-constrained generalization.

*Qi Liu,Wanjing Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-Agent is a configurable multi-agent research framework for automated scientific discovery that combines evolutionary selection, structured hypothesis management, and hierarchical reflection mechanisms to outperform evolutionary baselines in optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than simple program mutation; it needs structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection to enable controlled exploration beyond basic evolutionary loops.

Method: OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow with branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking. It features: 1) evolutionary-systematic ideation unifying evolutionary selection, comprehensive research planning, and coordinated exploration; 2) hierarchical reflection with short-term experimental reflection (verbal gradients), long-term reflection (verbal momentum), and memory compression (regularization).

Result: OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks (traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, multiple knapsack) and simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios, while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework.

Conclusion: OR-Agent offers a principled architecture for AI-assisted scientific discovery that effectively combines evolutionary approaches with structured hypothesis management and hierarchical reflection mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance and providing an open-source framework for automated research exploration.

Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

*Siyang Li,Chenhao Liu,Dongrui Wu,Zhigang Zeng,Lieyun Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StackingNet is a meta-ensemble framework that coordinates multiple black-box foundation models without accessing their internal parameters or training data, improving accuracy, reducing bias, and enabling reliability ranking through collective intelligence principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large foundation models have advanced AI capabilities in language, vision, and reasoning, they remain isolated systems that cannot readily share capabilities. Integrating complementary strengths of independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems, but there's no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models.

Method: StackingNet employs a meta-ensemble framework based on collective intelligence principles to combine model predictions during inference. It operates without access to internal parameters or training data, using stacking techniques to integrate predictions from diverse foundation models.

Result: Across language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating tasks, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness compared to individual models and classic ensembles. It reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance.

Conclusion: StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence by turning model diversity from a source of inconsistency into productive collaboration. The work suggests that AI progress may emerge not only from larger single models but also from principled cooperation among many specialized ones.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence built on large foundation models has transformed language understanding, vision and reasoning, yet these systems remain isolated and cannot readily share their capabilities. Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.

### [113] [Attention in Constant Time: Vashista Sparse Attention for Long-Context Decoding with Exponential Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13804)
*Vashista Nobaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows attention concentrates on few tokens with exponential decay for inactive ones; practical sparse attention mechanism achieves speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models incur high inference costs from attention over long contexts, but empirical evidence suggests only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query, creating opportunity for computational savings.

Method: Formalize attention as projection onto convex hull of key vectors with entropic relaxation; prove face-stability theorem showing exponential concentration; introduce Vashista Sparse Attention with paging-style context selection compatible with modern inference stacks.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show total mass on inactive tokens decays exponentially with support gap, while active face error scales linearly with temperature; practical implementation achieves stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in predicted regimes.

Conclusion: Sparse long-context decoding is safe when support gap criteria are met; Vashista Sparse Attention provides principled trade-off between accuracy and compute, with deployment benefits for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings through predictable latency without external dependencies.

Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-Ω(Δ/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts to ensure quality, security, and alignment with natural language specifications, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods for smart contract synthesis.

Method: Pipeline that parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks, and measures quality across five dimensions with composite scoring.

Result: Framework enables reproducible benchmarking of smart contract synthesis quality, supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifies alignment, and identifies systematic error modes like logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for empirical research on smart contract synthesis that can be extended to formal verification and compliance checking, addressing quality assurance challenges in LLM-generated contracts.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.

*Zhengmian Hu,Lei Shi,Ritwik Sinha,Justin Grover,David Arbour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Unified framework for online experimentation that prioritizes variants, explains results, and generates new creative opportunities using embeddings, historical data, and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online experimentation faces traffic scarcity requiring tough variant selection decisions, and post-hoc analysis is manual, inconsistent, and content-agnostic. Organizations underutilize historical A/B results and content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) CTR ranking model with treatment embeddings and historical outcomes using fixed effects for contextual shifts; (2) Projection onto semantic marketing attributes with sign-consistent sparse constrained Lasso for interpretability; (3) Opportunity index combining attribute importance with under-expression to flag high-impact attributes, with LLMs generating creative suggestions.

Result: Framework built into Adobe's "Experimentation Accelerator" product, with evaluation on real-world Adobe business customer experiments validating high quality of generation pipeline.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles by providing AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation, addressing key bottlenecks in modern online experimentation.

Abstract: Modern online experimentation faces two bottlenecks: scarce traffic forces tough choices on which variants to test, and post-hoc insight extraction is manual, inconsistent, and often content-agnostic. Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.

*Razeen A Rasheed,Somnath Banerjee,Animesh Mukherjee,Rima Hazra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that as AI research generation becomes cheap, the bottleneck shifts to auditability - verifying claim-evidence links. It proposes claim-level auditability as a key design target and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard with semantic provenance and protocolized validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep research agents can produce scientific reports quickly, the real challenge becomes verifying claims and tracing evidence. The dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to outputs with weak, missing, or misleading claim-evidence links, making auditability the critical bottleneck in AI-generated research.

Method: Proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design target, identifies recurring failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, unverifiable inference), introduces the AAR standard with four metrics (provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, audit effort), and advocates for semantic provenance with protocolized validation using persistent, queryable provenance graphs.

Result: The paper presents a framework for making auditability testable through measurable standards and proposes practical instrumentation patterns for deploying semantic provenance systems at scale, enabling continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication.

Conclusion: As AI research generation becomes inexpensive, auditability must become a primary design consideration. The AAR standard and semantic provenance approach provide a foundation for building verifiable, trustworthy research agents by making claim-evidence relationships explicit, persistent, and continuously validatable.

Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.

*Gabriel Romio,Mateus Begnini Melchiades,Bruno Castro da Silva,Gabriel de Oliveira Ramos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOC-2HER extends hierarchical reinforcement learning with dual hindsight experience replay to solve sparse-reward object manipulation tasks by creating virtual goals for both agent-object interaction and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical RL frameworks (Option-Critic, MOC) underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, particularly in object manipulation tasks where rewards depend on object states rather than agent actions, making it difficult for agents to discover how to interact with objects.

Method: First proposes MOC-HER by integrating Hindsight Experience Replay into MOC framework. Then introduces Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER) which creates two sets of virtual goals: one based on object's final state (standard HER) and another based on agent's effector positions, rewarding both interaction with object and task completion.

Result: MOC-2HER achieves success rates up to 90% in robotic manipulation environments, compared to less than 11% for both original MOC and MOC-HER, demonstrating significant improvement in sparse-reward, multi-goal tasks.

Conclusion: The dual objective relabeling strategy in 2HER effectively addresses the challenge of sparse rewards in object manipulation tasks by providing rewards for both agent-object interaction and task completion, enabling hierarchical RL agents to learn complex manipulation behaviors.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ambient Physics enables learning joint distributions of PDE coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations without requiring complete training data, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction with significantly fewer function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions is often expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Existing diffusion-based methods require complete observations for training, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with partial data.

Method: The framework randomly masks a subset of already-observed measurements and supervises on them, creating a training regime where the model cannot distinguish between "truly unobserved" and "artificially unobserved" regions, forcing it to produce plausible predictions everywhere.

Result: Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with a 62.51% reduction in average overall error compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while using 125× fewer function evaluations. The method also identifies a "one-point transition" phenomenon where masking a single observed point enables learning from partial observations.

Conclusion: Ambient Physics enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable by learning directly from partial observations without requiring complete training data, making it applicable to real-world scientific problems with limited measurement capabilities.

Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAIL uses imitation learning and inverse RL to learn goal-directed policies from potentially suboptimal demonstrations, enabling one-shot goal recognition that handles systematic biases and suboptimal behavior better than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal recognition methods rely on optimal goal-oriented policy representations, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder accurate goal recognition when demonstrations are suboptimal or systematically biased.

Method: Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL) leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from demonstration trajectories. It scores observed partial trajectories with each learned policy in a single forward pass.

Result: GRAIL increases F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, yields improvements up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

Conclusion: GRAIL contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments by handling suboptimal and systematically biased behavior while maintaining one-shot inference capability.

Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based methods for graph property detection rely on fixed visual graph layouts, which restricts their expressiveness and limits their ability to effectively detect structural properties in graphs.

Method: VSAL incorporates an adaptive layout generator that dynamically produces informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, enhancing the vision-based pipeline for graph property detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various graph property detection tasks including Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.

Conclusion: Adaptive layout generation significantly improves vision-based graph property detection by providing tailored visualizations, making VSAL a superior approach compared to methods using fixed layouts.

Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is fundamental to modern LLMs and critical for AI safety, but it exhibits pathologies that prevent it from being useful for monitoring. These pathologies need to be better understood and discriminated between.

Method: Created a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic to detect CoT pathologies. Developed model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies to validate the approach.

Result: The work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring. The metrics successfully discriminate between the three identified pathologies.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a framework for detecting and understanding CoT reasoning pathologies, providing tools that can be used for monitoring and safety interventions in LLM training and deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is fundamental to modern LLM architectures and represents a critical intervention point for AI safety. However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.

*Sha Li,Stefano Petrangeli,Yu Shen,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LaySPA is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs with explicit spatial reasoning for graphic layout design, producing interpretable reasoning traces and structured layouts while improving validity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses LLMs' limited spatial reasoning capabilities and lack of transparency in design decision-making for graphic layout generation.

Method: Reformulates layout design as policy learning over a structured textual spatial environment encoding canvas geometry, element attributes, and relationships. Uses multi-objective spatial critique (geometric validity, relational coherence, aesthetic consistency) and relative group optimization for stable training.

Result: Outperforms larger proprietary LLMs, achieves performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators with fewer annotated samples and reduced latency. Improves structural validity and visual quality.

Conclusion: LaySPA successfully equips LLMs with explicit spatial reasoning for transparent and controllable layout design, demonstrating superior performance with interpretable outputs.

Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Kaikai Wang,Xiaowen Zhang,Chen Yao,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyMem: A hybrid memory architecture for LLM agents that uses multi-granular memory representations and dynamic scheduling to balance efficiency and effectiveness in long dialogues, reducing computational cost by 92.6% while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents perform well in short-text contexts but struggle with extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a trade-off between efficiency (memory compression loses critical details) and effectiveness (retaining raw text creates computational overhead). Current systems lack the flexible, proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in human cognition.

Method: HyMem uses a hybrid memory architecture with multi-granular memory representations and dynamic on-demand scheduling. It employs a dual-granular storage scheme with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, and an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement.

Result: HyMem achieves strong performance on both LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context approaches while reducing computational cost by 92.6%. It establishes state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.

Conclusion: The HyMem architecture successfully addresses the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in LLM memory management by implementing cognitive economy principles through hybrid memory representations and dynamic scheduling, enabling LLM agents to handle extended dialogues more effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong performance in short-text contexts but often underperform in extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces statistically principled early stopping methods for LLM reasoning that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to prevent unnecessary reasoning steps, improving efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often overthink and generate unnecessary reasoning steps, especially under uncertainty with ill-posed or ambiguous queries, which reduces efficiency and reliability.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Parametric method models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process with sequential testing; 2) Nonparametric method provides finite-sample guarantees on probability of halting too early on well-posed queries.

Result: Empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across domains show uncertainty-aware early stopping improves both efficiency and reliability, with especially significant gains for math reasoning.

Conclusion: Statistically principled early stopping methods effectively mitigate LLM overthinking by monitoring uncertainty signals during generation, enhancing reasoning efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed PCM effectively addresses zero-shot trajectory prediction challenges by leveraging domain-invariant knowledge and kinematic integration, enabling robust generalization to previously unseen domains.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for traffic agents is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

*Ruicheng Zhang,Xinyi Li,Tianyi Xu,Shuhao Zhang,Xiaofei Liao,Hai Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuromem is a testbed for benchmarking External Memory Modules under streaming conditions with interleaved insertions and retrievals, evaluating five lifecycle dimensions across three datasets to reveal performance degradation with memory growth and structural limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of External Memory Modules assume static settings with offline memory building and fixed-state queries, but practical applications involve streaming data where new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and memory state evolves during query serving.

Method: Neuromem provides a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol, decomposing the memory lifecycle into five dimensions: memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. It evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack using three datasets (LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH) and reports token-level F1 scores and insertion/retrieval latency.

Result: Performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, with time-related queries remaining the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.

Conclusion: Neuromem provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating External Memory Modules under realistic streaming conditions, revealing that memory structure is the primary determinant of performance quality, while optimization techniques mainly trade off insertion and retrieval costs without significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.

*Guojie Liu,Yiqi Wang,Yanfeng Yang,Wenqi Fan,Songlei Jian,Jianfeng Zhang,Jie Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PIC (Parallelized Iterative Compression) improves context compression for LLMs by restricting memory tokens to local chunks via attention mask modifications, reducing training difficulty and achieving better performance, especially at high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long contexts increase LLM inference latency due to quadratic self-attention costs. Existing context compression methods compress entire contexts indiscriminately into memory tokens, requiring global dependency capture and extensive training data, making compression difficult.

Method: PIC modifies Transformer attention masks to restrict memory token receptive fields to sequential local chunks, inspired by human working memory chunking and empirical observations of memory embedding spatial specialization. This parallelized iterative approach lowers compressor training difficulty.

Result: PIC consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, with particularly strong gains at high compression ratios (29.8% F1 and 40.7% EM improvements on QA at 64× compression). Training is 40% faster for 16× compression while surpassing baseline peak performance.

Conclusion: PIC provides an effective solution to LLM context compression challenges by simplifying training through local chunk restrictions, achieving superior performance especially in high-compression scenarios while significantly reducing training time.

Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2AECF is a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework that enables flexible, efficient, and adaptive deployment of large AI models at the edge by transforming semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deployment of large AI models at the edge faces three fundamental limitations: 1) rigid task-model binding limiting flexibility, 2) computational/memory demands exceeding edge device capacity, and 3) static inference pipelines unable to respond to real-time task changes.

Method: P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three mechanisms: 1) prompt-defined cognition for task intent parsing into model-agnostic representations, 2) agent-based modular execution using lightweight reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on resource conditions, and 3) diffusion-controlled inference planning for adaptive execution strategy construction with runtime feedback.

Result: The framework is illustrated through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, demonstrating its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.

Conclusion: P2AECF addresses key limitations in edge AI deployment by enabling flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence through prompt-to-agent transformation, making large AI models more practical for edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.

*Jinzi Zou,Bolin Wang,Liang Li,Shuo Zhang,Nuo Xu,Junzhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FloCA is a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent that separates intent understanding/response generation (handled by LLM) from flowchart reasoning (handled by external topology-constrained graph execution tool) to ensure faithful, logically consistent node transitions in multi-turn decision-making dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face two key limitations in flowchart-oriented dialogue systems: (1) lack explicit mechanisms to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) are prone to hallucinations leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. The authors aim to address these limitations while maintaining the natural language capabilities of LLMs.

Method: FloCA uses a hybrid approach where an LLM handles intent understanding and response generation, while flowchart reasoning is delegated to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution. This separation ensures faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns without requiring flowchart-specific training.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets demonstrate the superiority of FloCA over existing LLM-based methods. The proposed evaluation framework with LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics (covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency) highlights bottlenecks in current approaches.

Conclusion: FloCA effectively addresses LLM limitations in flowchart-oriented dialogue by separating natural language processing from topology-constrained graph reasoning, ensuring faithful flowchart execution while maintaining conversational quality. The approach demonstrates the value of hybrid architectures for complex procedural reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Flowchart-oriented dialogue (FOD) systems aim to guide users through multi-turn decision-making or operational procedures by following a domain-specific flowchart to achieve a task goal. In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

TL;DR: FluxMem is a unified framework for adaptive memory organization in LLM agents that learns to select among multiple memory structures based on interaction context, achieving 9.18% and 6.14% improvements on long-horizon benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent memory systems have two key limitations: they use one-size-fits-all memory structures and don't adaptively select memory structures based on context, which hinders performance in heterogeneous interaction patterns and long-horizon scenarios.

Method: FluxMem provides a unified framework with multiple complementary memory structures. It learns to select among these structures using offline supervision from downstream response quality and memory utilization. The framework includes a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds.

Result: Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks (PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo) show average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14% respectively compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FluxMem demonstrates that adaptive memory organization through learned structure selection and robust memory fusion significantly improves LLM agent performance in long-horizon interactions, addressing key limitations of existing memory systems.

Abstract: Memory is critical for enabling large language model (LLM) based agents to maintain coherent behavior over long-horizon interactions. However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge-intensive VQA suffers from severe knowledge conflicts due to limitations of open-domain retrieval, and existing paradigms lack generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence.

Method: Proposes REAL framework with reasoning-pivot concept (atomic units emphasizing knowledge linkage). Uses Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD) as intra-model decoding strategy leveraging pivots for targeted conflict mitigation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The pivot-driven resolution paradigm effectively addresses knowledge conflicts in KI-VQA, validating the effectiveness of reasoning-pivot concept and the REAL framework.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (KI-VQA) frequently suffers from severe knowledge conflicts caused by the inherent limitations of open-domain retrieval. However, existing paradigms face critical limitations due to the lack of generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence. To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.

Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents face two critical challenges in web navigation: (1) sparse valid paths leading to inefficient exploration, and (2) noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception, despite recent integration of tree search for long-horizon reasoning.

Method: Plan-MCTS introduces a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space, decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding. Key components include: transforming sparse action space into Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, distilling noisy contexts into Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness, incorporating Dual-Gating Reward to validate both physical executability and strategic alignment, and implementing Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans.

Result: Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

Conclusion: Plan-MCTS effectively addresses the challenges of sparse valid paths and noisy context in web navigation by reformulating the problem through semantic Plan Space exploration, leading to improved performance and efficiency in autonomous web navigation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

TL;DR: GUI-GENESIS: A framework that automatically synthesizes lightweight GUI training environments from real-world applications using multimodal code models, providing deterministic code-native rewards to enable efficient post-training of GUI agents with 10x lower latency and significant cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training GUI agents on real-world applications faces three major challenges: high latency (slow interaction speeds), poor reproducibility (inconsistent environments), and unverifiable rewards (noisy visual proxies that make reward signals unreliable). These limitations hinder the development of agents with strong generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities.

Method: GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models. The framework automatically synthesizes training environments and equips them with "code-native rewards" - executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals, eliminating the noise from visual estimation methods.

Result: The framework reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks. Models can synthesize environments they cannot yet solve, suggesting potential for self-improving agents.

Conclusion: GUI-GENESIS provides the first framework for automatically synthesizing efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards, addressing key limitations of real-world application training. The approach enables more effective post-training of GUI agents, reduces costs significantly, and demonstrates superior performance on real-world tasks while revealing a pathway toward self-improving agents.

Abstract: Post-training GUI agents in interactive environments is critical for developing generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities. However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies.

TL;DR: Current LLMs show limited but emerging capability for steganographic chain-of-thought reasoning, where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text, posing potential safety risks that require continuous monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risk of LLMs learning to conceal their reasoning through steganographic techniques, which could compromise safety monitoring of chain-of-thought reasoning and enable deceptive behavior.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 28 models across generations, measuring monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines.

Result: Current models cannot sustain hidden reasoning for complex math/arithmetic tasks, but in simplified counting, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy. GPT-5.2 showed rare (<1%) paradoxical behavior of refusing while complying with steganographic instructions.

Conclusion: Steganographic reasoning poses emerging risks requiring continuous evaluation; the study provides methodology for preemptive detection and prevention of hidden reasoning that could enable misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.

Abstract: Monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a foundational safety technique for large language model (LLM) agents; however, this oversight is compromised if models learn to conceal their reasoning. We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.

TL;DR: AQI framework uses noncommutative algebraic structures inspired by quantum theory to expand semantic space and enable more creative LLM outputs by maintaining multiple future possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limited creative capacity because rich context strongly constrains future generations, making the process near-deterministic. Existing approaches like test-time scaling don't fundamentally address this structural limitation.

Method: Propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework using noncommutative algebraic structures inspired by quantum theory. Implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with 600+ specialized operators, representing semantic states as Hilbert space vectors and evolving them via C-values from noncommutative operators.

Result: AQI consistently outperforms strong baselines on creative reasoning benchmarks across ten domains, showing statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: Noncommutative algebraic dynamics provide a practical, reproducible foundation for machine creativity, with the architecture already deployed in real-world enterprise environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ForesightSafety Bench, a comprehensive AI safety evaluation framework covering 94 risk dimensions across fundamental, advanced, and industrial domains to address limitations in current safety assessment systems for rapidly evolving AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety evaluation systems have critical limitations including restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. Lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies cannot adequately address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models with increasing autonomy and goal-directed capabilities that create unpredictable, difficult-to-control, and potentially irreversible systemic risks.

Method: The authors propose the ForesightSafety Bench framework, which begins with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced domains including Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, plus 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. The framework accumulates structured risk data and assessment results to create a comprehensive, hierarchical, and dynamically evolving evaluation system.

Result: The benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results. Systematic evaluation of over twenty mainstream advanced large models revealed widespread safety vulnerabilities across multiple pillars, particularly in Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety, and Catastrophic and Existential Risks. Key risk patterns and capability boundaries were identified.

Conclusion: The ForesightSafety Bench framework addresses critical gaps in current AI safety evaluation by providing a comprehensive, hierarchical, and dynamic assessment system covering 94 risk dimensions. The benchmark reveals significant safety vulnerabilities in frontier AI models and establishes a foundation for more effective safety evaluation and risk mitigation in rapidly evolving AI systems.

Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks. Our benchmark is released at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/ForesightSafety-Bench. The project website is available at https://foresightsafety-bench.beijing-aisi.ac.cn/.

TL;DR: Agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for gene-disease validity curation that optimizes both outcome accuracy and process alignment through hierarchical multi-agent system with process-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence with traceable justifications, but current LLM multi-agent systems focus mainly on outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards, particularly in gene-disease validity curation where experts must synthesize diverse biomedical evidence.

Method: Introduces an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework with two objectives: (1) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (2) efficient coordination via hierarchical multi-agent system. Uses GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent in multi-agent system.

Result: On ClinGen dataset: With outcome-only rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 (base model) to 0.732, but poor process alignment (0.392 F1). With process+outcome rewards, MAS achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

Conclusion: The agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework with process-level supervision enables multi-agent systems to achieve both high outcome accuracy and process alignment in clinical decision-making tasks like gene-disease validity curation, addressing the limitation of current systems that optimize primarily for outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

TL;DR: Earth-science text QA is more crucial than visual training for UHR remote sensing reasoning; staged knowledge injection (text QA first, then image-text examples) outperforms larger general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution remote sensing faces bottlenecks in visual evidence acquisition, requiring localization of tiny regions in massive pixel spaces. Standard reinforcement learning struggles without structured domain priors.

Method: Proposes staged knowledge injection: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures; (2) "pre-warming" on hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize subsequent tool-based RL. Compares Cold-start SFT, RLVR, and Agentic RLVR paradigms.

Result: Achieves 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing new state-of-the-art. Counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains.

Conclusion: Domain-specific text QA injects concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval in UHR remote sensing. Staged knowledge injection (text-first approach) effectively addresses visual evidence acquisition bottlenecks.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) is usually bottlenecked by visual evidence acquisition: the model necessitates localizing tiny task-relevant regions in massive pixel spaces. While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) "pre-warming" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs) benchmark autonomous agents on managing dozens of concurrent long-horizon tasks with dependencies and reprioritization. CorpGen framework addresses four failure modes with hierarchical planning, sub-agent isolation, tiered memory, and adaptive summarization, achieving 3.5x improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation, but real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. There's a need for environments that test coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks within persistent contexts spanning hours.

Method: Introduces Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs) as a distinct problem class requiring execution across 45+ interleaved tasks (500-1500+ steps). Presents CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework with: 1) hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, 2) sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, 3) tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and 4) adaptive summarization. Simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules.

Result: Identifies four failure modes causing baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%: context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.

Conclusion: MHTEs represent a critical challenge for autonomous agents in real organizational settings. CorpGen's architectural mechanisms (hierarchical planning, sub-agent isolation, tiered memory, adaptive summarization) effectively address the identified failure modes, with performance gains stemming from the architecture rather than specific CUA implementations. The framework enables stable performance under increasing task loads.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations.

TL;DR: REDSearcher is a unified framework for optimizing LLMs for deep search tasks by codesigning task synthesis, mid-training, and post-training to address sparsity of high-quality search trajectories and reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face challenges in deep search tasks due to extreme sparsity of high-quality search trajectories and reward signals, stemming from difficulties in scalable long-horizon task construction and high costs of interaction-heavy rollouts with external tools.

Method: REDSearcher introduces: (1) dual-constrained optimization for task synthesis with precise difficulty control via graph topology and evidence dispersion; (2) tool-augmented queries to encourage proactive tool use; (3) mid-training to strengthen core atomic capabilities (knowledge, planning, function calling); (4) local simulated environment for low-cost RL experimentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across both text-only and multimodal search-agent benchmarks, and will release 10K high-quality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories, 1K text RL query set, plus code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: REDSearcher provides a scalable framework for optimizing search agents by addressing key bottlenecks in task synthesis, training efficiency, and evaluation, facilitating future research on long-horizon search agents.

Abstract: Large language models are transitioning from generalpurpose knowledge engines to realworld problem solvers, yet optimizing them for deep search tasks remains challenging. The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: Proposes Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework for comparing AI models when human comprehension of tasks becomes infeasible, using critique-resilient correctness where answers are correct unless convincingly proven otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the "post-comprehension regime" where frontier LLMs saturate benchmarks faster than humans can create discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground truth, or evaluate complex solutions, threatening our ability to measure AI progress.

Method: Uses an adversarial framework with critique-resilient correctness: answers are deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Humans serve as bounded verifiers focusing on localized claims. Employs an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model to jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve tasks and generate difficult yet solvable questions.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing stable scores that correlate with external capability measures. The framework successfully reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game.

Conclusion: Critique-Resilient Benchmarking provides a viable approach to compare AI models when full human comprehension becomes infeasible, preserving evaluation integrity through adversarial verification and localized human judgment.

Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.

*Neil F. Johnson,Frank Y. Huo*

TL;DR: The paper identifies a novel mechanism for dangerous tipping points in edge AI language models, showing that competition for attention at the atomistic scale creates mathematical tipping points that can be predicted and controlled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of edge AI devices running language models without Internet connectivity creates safety risks (self-harm, financial losses, extremism) that existing safety tools cannot address due to their reliance on cloud connectivity or post-harm detection.

Method: The authors identify that dangerous tipping originates from competition for attention at the atomistic scale in edge AI, deriving a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n* governed by dot-product competition between conversation context and competing output basins.

Result: The mechanism is validated against multiple AI models and can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad', making it applicable across domains (health, law, finance, defense), legal landscapes, languages, and cultural settings.

Conclusion: The paper reveals new control levers for edge AI safety by mathematically characterizing attention competition tipping points, providing a framework for proactive safety interventions across diverse applications and regulatory environments.

Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in reasoning models that generate intermediate reasoning traces, understanding of how RTs support reasoning and their limitations remains incomplete. The authors aim to promote greater clarity about the benefits and limitations of reasoning trace paradigms.

Method: Introduced PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic with corresponding proofs. Focused on length generalization as a benchmark for robust reasoning. Proposed notions of task depth (steps required to solve) and task breadth (unique examples across task). Varied these quantities across PITA subsets and compared RT models to non-RT baselines. Also compared results to a simple synthetic syllogism task.

Result: RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, but deteriorate on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. The study suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, while highlighting their generalization strengths on broad tasks.

Conclusion: The findings identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces. RT models excel at broad tasks but face scaling limitations on deep reasoning tasks, providing insights into the general phenomena of reasoning trace paradigms beyond the specific PITA dataset.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.

TL;DR: PIR transforms LLM reasoning from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents, using adaptive selection and test-time internalization to shorten reasoning traces while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflates computational costs and can degrade performance. The authors are inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error.

Method: Proposes Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) with two key components: 1) Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs a compact set of precedents for each question and LLM by ranking examples using joint scores of semantic similarity and model perplexity, adapting the amount to maximize perplexity reduction; 2) Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) performs test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: PIR successfully transforms LLM reasoning from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents, addressing both what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them, resulting in more efficient reasoning with better computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and identify unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing AI models, particularly as LLM capabilities evolve and agentic AI proliferates, requiring updated risk assessment frameworks.

Introduces more complex scenarios for each dimension, including LLM-to-LLM persuasion tests, emergent misalignment experiments, monitoring agent "mis-evolution" in memory/tool expansion, and resource-constrained self-replication scenarios.

Result: The framework provides comprehensive risk analysis across five critical dimensions with updated scenarios, identifies emerging threats in frontier AI, and proposes validated mitigation strategies for secure deployment.

Conclusion: This work reflects current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges, providing a preliminary technical pathway for secure frontier AI deployment.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [147] [Bounding Probabilities of Causation with Partial Causal Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14503)
*Yuxuan Xie,Ang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: General framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information via optimization programming, extending applicability to realistic incomplete causal knowledge settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilities of causation are fundamental for individual-level explanation and decision making but are inherently counterfactual and not point-identifiable from data. Existing bounds have limitations: they disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting practical use in real-world applications where causal information is often partial but nontrivial.

Method: Proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. Shows how available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in an optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without requiring full identifiability.

Result: The approach yields tighter bounds than existing methods by incorporating available partial causal information. It extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative, without requiring complete causal graphs or binary settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables practical use of probabilities of causation in real-world applications by systematically incorporating partial causal information through optimization programming, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require complete causal knowledge or make restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to individual-level explanation and decision making, yet they are inherently counterfactual and not point-identifiable from data in general. Existing bounds either disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting their practical use. In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative.

### [148] [Formally Verifying and Explaining Sepsis Treatment Policies with COOL-MC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14505)
*Dennis Gross*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COOL-MC is a tool that combines formal verification and explainability to analyze reinforcement learning policies for sepsis treatment, making them safer and more interpretable by constructing reachable state spaces and using PCTL queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning policies for sepsis treatment optimization are opaque and difficult to verify, while standard probabilistic model checkers are infeasible for large MDPs and cannot explain why policies make particular decisions.

Method: COOL-MC wraps Storm model checker with three key capabilities: constructs only reachable state space induced by trained policy, automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions, and integrates explainability methods with PCTL queries to reveal feature importance.

Result: Applied to ICU-Sepsis MDP (17,000 patient records), established hard bounds via full MDP verification, trained safe RL policy achieving optimal survival probability, and revealed that policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than patient's evolving condition.

Conclusion: COOL-MC serves as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment by exposing weaknesses invisible to standard evaluation through integration of formal verification and explainability.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.

### [149] [Diagnosing Knowledge Conflict in Multimodal Long-Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14518)
*Jing Tang,Kun Wang,Haolang Lu,Hongjin Chen,KaiTao Chen,Zhongxiang Sun,Qiankun Li,Lingjuan Lyu,Guoshun Nan,Zhigang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with conflicting knowledge in long chain-of-thought reasoning; the paper formalizes knowledge conflict types, reveals how conflicts are encoded in model representations, and enables diagnosis/control of reasoning failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often fail in long chain-of-thought reasoning when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals, but the mechanisms behind these failures are not well understood.

Method: Formalized knowledge conflict into input-level objective conflict vs. process-level effective conflict, then probed internal representations to analyze conflict encoding patterns through linear separability, depth localization, hierarchical consistency, and directional asymmetry.

Result: Found that: (I) conflict types are linearly separable features, (II) conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, (III) aggregating token-level signals recovers input-level conflict types, and (IV) reinforcing implicit source preference is easier than enforcing opposite source.

Conclusion: Provides mechanism-level understanding of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict, enabling principled diagnosis and control of long chain-of-thought failures in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.

### [150] [Disentangling Deception and Hallucination Failures in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14529)
*Haolang Lu,Hongrui Peng,WeiYe Fu,Guoshun Nan,Xinye Cao,Xingrui Li,Hongcan Guo,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes separating knowledge existence from behavioral expression to distinguish between hallucination and deception in LLM failures, analyzing them through controlled experiments and internal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analysis of LLM failures often conflates different failure mechanisms by focusing only on behavioral outputs, particularly in factual question answering where incorrect outputs are typically attributed to missing knowledge. The authors aim to distinguish between fundamentally different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level.

Method: The authors construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions where knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. They analyze failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

Result: The paper demonstrates that hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that can be distinguished through internal mechanism analysis rather than just output behavior. The controlled environment allows for systematic study of these distinct failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: A mechanism-oriented perspective separating Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression provides a more nuanced understanding of LLM failures, revealing that similar output-level errors can stem from fundamentally different internal mechanisms, with important implications for diagnosing and addressing model failures.

Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

*Gabriel Roccabruna,Olha Khomyn,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATEO is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating LVLMs' temporal reasoning abilities using professional recipe data with graph-based Temporal Execution Order annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, linear approximations of TEO, or text-only inputs, creating a gap in assessing multimodal temporal reasoning for real-world planning.

Method: Created MATEO benchmark using high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus with standardized editorial process; collected TEO annotations as graphs via scalable crowdsourcing pipeline; evaluated six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, language context variations, multimodal input structures, and fine-tuning strategies.

Result: The paper introduces the MATEO benchmark and presents evaluation results for six state-of-the-art LVLMs, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: MATEO addresses the gap in assessing multimodal temporal reasoning for planning tasks and provides a benchmark for evaluating and improving LVLMs' temporal execution understanding.

Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

*Erkan Karabulut,Daniel Daza,Paul Groth,Martijn C. Schut,Victoria Degeler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabProbe: A framework using tabular foundation models (TFMs) for association rule mining without frequent itemset mining, achieving high-quality rules with strong predictive performance even in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical ARM methods suffer from rule explosion and poor scalability due to frequent itemset mining, while recent neural approaches degrade in low-data settings. TFMs offer strong in-context generalization capabilities that could address these limitations.

Method: Introduces a model-agnostic framework for extracting association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data. TabProbe instantiates this framework using TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules without frequent itemset mining.

Result: TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance across tabular datasets of varying sizes. The approach remains robust in low-data settings without requiring task-specific training.

Conclusion: TabProbe demonstrates that TFMs can effectively address limitations of both classical and recent neural ARM methods, providing scalable, high-quality association rule mining with good generalization in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

### [153] [Arbor: A Framework for Reliable Navigation of Critical Conversation Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14643)
*Luís Silva,Diogo Gonçalves,Catarina Farinha,Clara Matos,Luís Ungaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Arbor is a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized node-level tasks to improve LLM performance in structured workflows like healthcare triage, achieving significant accuracy, latency, and cost improvements over monolithic prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains like healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches encoding entire decision structures in single prompts suffer from instruction-following degradation, lost-in-the-middle effects, and context window overflow as prompt length increases.

Method: Arbor decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into edge-list representations and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a DAG-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via dedicated LLM calls, and delegates response generation to separate inference steps. The framework is agnostic to underlying decision logic and model provider.

Result: Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. Smaller models using Arbor can match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.

Conclusion: Architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling more reliable and efficient structured workflow execution with LLMs. The approach demonstrates that specialized task decomposition can overcome limitations of monolithic prompting in complex decision-making domains.

Abstract: Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step.

*Aniol Civit,Antonio Rago,Antonio Andriella,Guillem Alenyà,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Base Score Extraction Functions map user preferences over arguments to base scores in bipolar argumentation frameworks, enabling easier creation of quantitative argumentation systems without requiring expert score assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Base score assignment in gradual argumentation requires user expertise and is often non-straightforward. Organizing arguments by preference could simplify this process, making argumentation systems more accessible and practical for real-world applications.

Method: Introduces Base Score Extraction Functions that map user preferences over arguments to base scores, transforming Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks with preferences into Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks. Includes algorithm for base score extraction that approximates non-linearities in human preferences.

Result: Provides theoretical and experimental evaluation in a robotics setting, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness. Offers practical recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in real applications.

Conclusion: Base Score Extraction Functions offer a systematic way to derive base scores from user preferences, making gradual argumentation more accessible and practical while maintaining the ability to use established computational tools in the field.

Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.

*Attila Lischka,Balázs Kulcsár*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard optimization problem for evacuating people by bus within a time limit, and solves it using deep reinforcement learning with graph learning for fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency evacuations are increasingly needed due to both man-made and natural disasters (exacerbated by climate change). Current car-focused evacuations cause congestion and disorder, necessitating effective bus-based evacuation methods that can quickly generate evacuation plans.

Method: Proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning to solve the BEOP. The approach achieves fast inference speed (fractions of seconds) after training. An MILP formulation is used to bound the gap of evacuation plans.

Result: The method achieves near-optimal solution quality and is validated using real-world San Francisco road networks and travel times. It can determine how many evacuation vehicles are needed to achieve specific bus-based evacuation quotas within predefined time constraints while maintaining adequate run time.

Conclusion: The proposed deep reinforcement learning approach effectively solves the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem, providing fast, near-optimal evacuation plans that can help reduce congestion in emergency scenarios and optimize resource allocation for bus-based evacuations.

Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.

TL;DR: Proposes using top-k planning to generate diverse plans for goal recognition benchmarks, introduces Version Coverage Score metric, and shows state-of-the-art goal recognizers degrade under low observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal recognition datasets suffer from systematic bias induced by heuristic-based forward search planning systems, lacking challenge for realistic scenarios where agents use different planners, impacting evaluation of goal recognizers.

Method: Uses top-k planning to generate multiple different plans for the same goal hypothesis, creating benchmarks that mitigate current dataset bias. Introduces Version Coverage Score (VCS) metric to measure goal recognizer resilience when inferring goals based on different plan sets.

Result: Results show that resilience of current state-of-the-art goal recognizer degrades substantially under low observability settings when evaluated with the new benchmark methodology.

Conclusion: The proposed method using top-k planning creates more realistic benchmarks for goal recognition evaluation, revealing limitations of current approaches under diverse planning scenarios and low observability conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.

### [157] [Evolutionary System Prompt Learning can Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14697)
*Lunjun Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E-SPL is a method that combines reinforcement learning with evolutionary system prompt learning to jointly improve model contexts (prompts) and model weights through parallel rollouts, evolutionary updates, and TrueSkill-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM self-improvement mechanisms are limited to either self-reflection for context updates or reinforcement learning for weight updates, but not both jointly. The goal is to develop agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience by better integrating declarative knowledge (in prompts) and procedural knowledge (in weights).

Method: E-SPL runs parallel rollouts with multiple system prompts in each RL iteration, applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each prompt, and evolves the prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. TrueSkill ratings track prompt performance for evolutionary selection, enabling joint optimization of contexts and weights.

Result: E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% to 45.1% in easy-to-hard generalization (AIME → BeyondAIME), outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). The method shows consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization across reasoning and agentic tasks.

Conclusion: Coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution enables more effective autonomous self-improvement by leveraging the natural division between declarative knowledge in prompts and procedural knowledge in weights, leading to better performance and generalization.

Abstract: Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models in nuclear crisis simulation demonstrate sophisticated strategic behavior including deception, theory of mind, and metacognition, validating some strategic theories while challenging others, particularly regarding nuclear escalation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how frontier AI models reason and behave in high-stakes strategic scenarios like nuclear crises, and to assess their alignment with or deviation from established human strategic theory, with implications for national security and AI's role in strategic decision-making.

Method: Crisis simulation with three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) playing opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis scenario, analyzing their strategic behavior, decision-making patterns, and escalation dynamics.

Result: Models demonstrated sophisticated strategic capabilities including deception, theory of mind, and metacognition. They validated some strategic theories (Schelling, Kahn, Jervis) but challenged others: nuclear taboo was no impediment to escalation, strategic nuclear attacks occurred, threats provoked counter-escalation, high credibility accelerated conflict, and models never chose accommodation or withdrawal.

Conclusion: AI simulation is a powerful tool for strategic analysis but requires calibration against human reasoning patterns. Understanding how frontier models imitate or deviate from human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world where AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

Method: A workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, handling inconsistencies between schema and facts, leveraging reasoning for implicit knowledge, serializing in OWL format, and providing utilities for tensor representations compatible with ML libraries.

Result: A curated suite of datasets including newly extracted datasets from knowledge graphs with expressive schemas and enriched existing datasets with schema information, all serialized in OWL and ready for reasoning services.

Conclusion: RESOURCE provides the first comprehensive resource for evaluating knowledge graph refinement methods that require both schema and ground facts, addressing a critical gap in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Datasets for the experimental evaluation of knowledge graph refinement algorithms typically contain only ground facts, retaining very limited schema level knowledge even when such information is available in the source knowledge graphs. This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.

TL;DR: StarWM introduces the first world model for StarCraft II that predicts future observations under partial observability, enabling foresight-driven policy refinement through a Generate-Simulate-Refine decision loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based SC2 agents focus on improving policies but overlook integrating learnable, action-conditioned transition models into decision loops, creating a gap in leveraging world models for complex decision-making in partially observable environments.

Method: Proposes StarWM world model with structured textual representation factorizing observations into five semantic modules, constructs SC2-Dynamics-50k instruction-tuning dataset, develops multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework, and implements StarWM-Agent with Generate-Simulate-Refine decision loop.

Result: StarWM achieves nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency over zero-shot baselines. StarWM-Agent shows win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7) AI levels, with improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.

Conclusion: Integrating a learnable world model into LLM-based decision systems significantly enhances performance in complex, partially observable environments like StarCraft II, demonstrating the value of foresight-driven policy refinement through structured observation prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.

*Chenyang Ma,Clyde Fare,Matthew Wilson,Dave Braines*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmbeWebAgent is a framework that embeds agents directly into existing UIs using frontend hooks and backend workflows, enabling robust multi-step behaviors with minimal retrofitting effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most web agents operate at the human interface level (screenshots or DOM trees) without application-level access, limiting robustness and action expressiveness. Enterprise settings offer explicit control of both frontend and backend, creating an opportunity for more capable agents.

Method: Uses lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, per-page function registry exposed via WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow for reasoning and action execution. Framework is stack-agnostic (React, Angular, etc.), supports mixed-granularity actions (GUI primitives to higher-level composites), and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools.

Result: Demonstrates minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in live UI settings. The framework enables agents to operate with application-level access rather than just human interface observations.

Conclusion: EmbeWebAgent provides a practical framework for embedding agents directly into existing enterprise UIs, overcoming limitations of traditional web agents by leveraging both frontend and backend control available in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Most web agents operate at the human interface level, observing screenshots or raw DOM trees without application-level access, which limits robustness and action expressiveness. In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/Cy06Ljee1JQ

### [163] [Concept Influence: Leveraging Interpretability to Improve Performance and Efficiency in Training Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14869)
*Matthew Kowal,Goncalo Paulo,Louis Jaburi,Tom Tseng,Lev E McKinney,Stefan Heimersheim,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Kellin Pelrine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Influence, a scalable Training Data Attribution method that attributes model behavior to semantic directions (like linear probes or SAE features) rather than individual test examples, addressing computational and semantic limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TDA methods like influence functions are computationally expensive and biased toward syntactic similarity due to attribution based on single test examples, making them impractical for large models and unable to capture abstract behaviors.

Method: Introduces Concept Influence which attributes model behavior to semantic directions (linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual datapoints, and shows that simple probe-based methods are first-order approximations that achieve comparable performance with much greater speed.

Result: Concept Influence and its approximations achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable (over an order-of-magnitude faster), validated across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating interpretable structure into traditional TDA pipelines enables more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data, addressing key limitations of existing attribution methods.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

### [164] [Lifted Relational Probabilistic Inference via Implicit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14890)
*Luise Ge,Brendan Juba,Kris Nilsson,Alison Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First polynomial-time framework for implicitly learning first-order probabilistic logic and performing lifted inference over individuals and worlds without explicit model construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconcile tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains; address challenge of learning probabilistic models from partial, noisy observations when traditional lifted inference requires complete models.

Method: Merge incomplete first-order axioms with partially observed examples into bounded-degree sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy; perform two lifts simultaneously: grounding-lift (renaming-equivalent ground moments share variables) and world-lift (enforce all pseudo-models in parallel).

Result: First polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds without constructing explicit models.

Conclusion: Successfully reconciles inductive learning and deductive reasoning through implicit learning-to-reason approach, enabling efficient probabilistic inference in first-order relational domains from incomplete data.

Abstract: Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.

### [165] [The Potential of CoT for Reasoning: A Closer Look at Trace Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14903)
*Gregor Bachmann,Yichen Jiang,Seyed Mohsen Moosavi Dezfooli,Moin Nabi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs reveals surprising patterns: non-monotonic potentials, sharp reasoning spikes, lucky guesses, and high transferability where partial CoT from stronger models can unlock weaker models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the driving forces behind the success of Chain-of-Thought prompting in large language models, particularly how different parts of CoT reasoning contribute to final answers, given that the mechanisms remain largely unclear despite its widespread use.

Method: Introduces the concept of "potential" to quantify how much each part of CoT reasoning increases the likelihood of correct completion. Analyzes CoT traces from competition-level mathematics questions, examining patterns in potential. Investigates CoT transferability by measuring weaker models' performance using partial CoT from stronger models.

Result: Identifies surprising patterns: (1) strong non-monotonicity due to reasoning tangents, (2) sharp but sometimes hard-to-interpret spikes (reasoning insights/jumps), (3) lucky guesses where models reach correct answers without relevant justifications. Shows high transferability - as little as 20% of partial CoT from stronger models can unlock weaker models' performance on previously unsolvable problems.

Conclusion: CoT reasoning in LLMs exhibits complex patterns that only partially align with human intuition. While some behaviors (insights, tangents) are interpretable, others remain mysterious. The high transferability of CoT suggests that much of its mechanics are model-agnostic and can be leveraged to boost weaker models' performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.

### [166] [Position: Introspective Experience from Conversational Environments as a Path to Better Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14910)
*Claudiu Cristian Musat,Jackson Tolins,Diego Antognini,Jingling Li,Martin Klissarov,Tom Duerig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that robust AI reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection internalized from high-quality social interaction, not just from scale, proposing that optimizing conversational scaffolds is key to next-generation general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training treats reasoning as an emergent property of scale, but the authors argue this approach is insufficient. They propose that robust reasoning actually emerges from linguistic self-reflection that develops through high-quality social interaction, drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology to challenge the prevailing scale-centric paradigm.

Method: The paper advances three core positions centered on Introspection: 1) Social Genesis of the Private Mind - learning from conversational environments as a primary way to understand the world, where alignment friction with other agents refines reasoning; 2) Dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences that decouple learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw data into learnable narratives; 3) Dialogue Quality as the New Data Quality - where reasoning depth and computational efficiency depend on the diversity and rigor of mastered dialogues.

Result: The paper presents a theoretical framework that shifts focus from scale-based reasoning emergence to dialogically-mediated reasoning development. It establishes conversational quality as the critical determinant of reasoning capability and computational efficiency, proposing that optimizing these conversational scaffolds should be the primary lever for advancing general intelligence.

Conclusion: Optimizing conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for developing the next generation of general intelligence, as robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection internalized from high-quality social interaction rather than merely from scale. The paper calls for a paradigm shift from scale-centric approaches to dialogically-mediated reasoning development.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI training treat reasoning as an emergent property of scale. We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAC-AMP is a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration system using LLM-based agents for multi-objective antimicrobial peptide design, featuring autonomous peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning that optimizes activity, toxicity, novelty, and structural reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address antimicrobial resistance by improving AMP design, overcoming limitations of current AI models that struggle to balance multiple objectives (activity, toxicity, novelty) and use rigid/unclear scoring methods that produce hard-to-interpret "black box" results.

Method: A closed-loop multi-agent collaboration system based on LLMs with autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework. Requires only task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs through multi-agent collaboration with cross-domain transferability.

Result: MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.

Conclusion: The closed-loop multi-agent system provides an explainable, multi-objective optimization approach for AMP design that addresses key limitations of existing methods while maintaining cross-domain transferability and interpretability.

Abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.

### [169] [On the Semantics of Primary Cause in Hybrid Dynamic Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14994)
*Shakil M. Khan,Asim Mehmood,Sandra Zilles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two equivalent definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework (hybrid temporal situation calculus) that handles both discrete and continuous change, with one definition being foundational and the other using contributions verified via modified "but-for" test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Actual causation is fundamental to rationality but existing formal accounts have largely focused on discrete change, despite the real world having both discrete and continuous (hybrid) changes. There's a need for causal reasoning frameworks that can handle hybrid systems.

Method: The authors propose two definitions of primary cause within the hybrid temporal situation calculus framework: (1) a foundational definition, and (2) a definition formalizing causation through contributions that can be verified using a modified "but-for" test. They prove the equivalence of these two definitions.

Result: The paper proves that the two proposed definitions of primary cause are equivalent. Additionally, it demonstrates that these definitions possess intuitively justifiable properties for causal reasoning in hybrid systems.

Conclusion: The work provides a formal account of actual causation in hybrid systems, bridging the gap between discrete and continuous change reasoning with two equivalent definitions that have desirable properties for practical application.

Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.

*Alisa Vinogradova,Vlad Vinogradov,Luba Greenwood,Ilya Yasny,Dmitry Kobyzev,Shoman Kasbekar,Kong Nguyen,Dmitrii Radkevich,Roman Doronin,Andrey Doronichev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bioptic Agent outperforms major AI systems in drug asset scouting across multilingual sources with 79.7% F1 score, addressing the critical need for comprehensive discovery of non-US biopharmaceutical innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The biopharmaceutical innovation landscape has shifted with most new drug assets originating outside the US and being disclosed through regional, non-English channels. China accounts for nearly half of global patent filings and ~30% of drug development. Current AI agents fail to achieve high-recall discovery across heterogeneous multilingual sources without hallucinations, creating multi-billion-dollar risks for investors and business development teams who need complete asset scouting coverage.

Method: Proposed a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and developed Bioptic Agent, a tuned, tree-based self-learning system. Constructed a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline with complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets outside US-centric radar. Collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals as priors for conditional benchmark query generation. Used LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions for grading.

Result: Bioptic Agent achieved 79.7% F1 score, significantly outperforming competing systems: Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%), Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research (50.6%), GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), Perplexity Deep Research (44.2%), and Exa Websets (26.9%). Performance improved steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.

Conclusion: The Bioptic Agent demonstrates superior performance in drug asset scouting across multilingual sources, addressing the critical need for comprehensive discovery of non-US biopharmaceutical innovations. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmarking methodology and show that increased computational resources lead to better performance in this high-stakes domain.

Abstract: Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.
  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.
